1st verse 
this is that lost ass track offtherack kind of a track 
you forced to rap remember that it's that 
you know where i'm at there go the gat 
pass me a bat the killorbekilled kind of attack 
steamin'  speedin' navigatin' the map 
negotiating with a chick she got her head on your lap ya hand on your gat 
premeditated plan of attack with two of your most deadliest mens in the back 
comb the block stop in the zone that's hot 
get out like you own the spot home or not 
it's that no mood to play move out the my way 
yo i been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day 
hey yo this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle 
turn it up loud make the whole block rattle 
boom boom this one is gettin' blazin' hot 
boom boom make you bust another shot from the glock 
 
chorus 
from the streets below to everything above 
to the heart that pumps rakim allah's blood 
i swear i kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
from the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
i'm number one and competition is still none 
and i'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
 
2nd verse 
here we come now 
turntable spin like a merrygoround 
never slow down depending on how good your stereo sounds 
set it up in the hood where we go surround 
tearin' through towns turn 'em into burial grounds 
this is the track that made theodore wanna scratch 
the track that caused the first kid to spin on his back 
and then we saw kids spraypainting the wall 
while some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law 
it's no antidote it's what you can't provoke 
so just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke 
and take a real hit soon as it bang you feel quick 
it's real thick this is that ol' real shit 
this is the description of designs for you to listen to 
reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular 
keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee 
have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40 
 
chorus 
from the streets below to everything above 
to the heart that pumps rakim allah's blood 
i swear i kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
from the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
i'm number one and competition is still none 
and i'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
 
3rd verse 
you know what this is 
yeah kid give up your riches 
vicious visions is not for motion pictures 
unstoppable rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas 
or witcha missus gettin tropical kisses 
makin' faces anticipatin' places her tongue hits 
suck her neck or just peck better to funk it 
the ep is in effect from dusk to sunset 
she want a rim shot all over her drum set 
jump the bed rubbin' your head it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset 
hell no doomstick big as a elbow 
gel soft well blow give him a minute he'll grow 
and all you gotta do is play the track again 
i'm ready and revived baby back again 
 
chorus 
from the streets below to everything above 
to the heart that pumps rakim allah's blood 
i swear i kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
from the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
i'm number one and competition is still none 
and i'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
yo 
check it yo 
 
i'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert 
in twentytwo yards per second to catch me to daily delicatessen 
it takes me thirty minutes to eat 'em forty minutes to digest'em 
and fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
so ask yourself a questionwhat question 
can the canibus rhyme 
is a fuckin porcupine half swine 
no time to make up your mind you wanna run or die
clip you while you're running by trip you up from behind 
my rhymes confuse niggas 
like somebody try to gangbang 
wearin' a blue shirt and red pants throwin' up signs with there left hand 
standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
god dam eggplants niggas getting' me vexed man 
cause i'm surrounded by garbage like fred sav 
and i can't seem to get away from it 
i dreamed that i stabbed leviathan through the stomach and ate from it 
in my past life i slayed hundreds and in the life before that 
i played trumpets to warn you that i was comin' 
there's one billion ways to die and i already tried 
ninehundred million nine hundred and ninety nine 
when i aim and fire my rhymes like a hundred cannon balls flying 
striking you one at a time in a parallel line 
while the art of emceeing is steady dying 
canibus and rakim allah is still in there prime 
 
chorus 
from the streets below to everything above 
to the heart that pumps rakim allah's blood 
i swear i kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
from the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
i'm number one and competition is still none 
and i'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs

yeah with no further adieu
you know who it is
uh ghettos across the world
yo this is what they want
new york city it's what they need
east coast to west coast it's what it is
across seas worldwide baby
aiyyo we stuck in a time of drought nothin to rhyme to about
ghetto of crime on the grind pull an iron out
industry cryin out major labels buyin out
who put the fire out real hip hop is dyin out
sound like the perfect time for ra to set off the new beginnin
let me finish where nas left off
i went to la to get with dre we tried to bridge the gap and
take night mix it with day i guess it wasn't meant to happen
my move a lotta dudes hope i lose but it's cool baby
bounce like medallions till it's off the chain
and i remain up in the lab till it's engulfed in flames
a new block like times square and forty doo wop
without the gun on my hip i bring the new hop
for scott larock freaky ty l eye biggie smalls and tupac
so where my goons at  stand up we right here
where my thugs at  stand up we right here
and all the ogs  stand up we right here
bounce for yourself homie make yourself be heard
but you don't have to dance play it cool and listen
cause you know what this is we give 'em the business
your crew is number 1 if not best and better
here's a hit the 18th letter
this is hell and hell is where the storm is drugs sellers killed for cornets
death is here to haunt us the president's still in office
the heavens hear the horrors and let us feel what war is
deadly weather spill before us to sever seals upon us
rakim up here begin to fear the end is here your goners
stiff as rigarmortis now let 'em feel the chorus
the god spit i'm still here y'all stick for real performance
record deals and tourin my rep is still enormous
i hit the block or party and mommies be watching pappy
the show get smashed photographed by the paparazzi
my army's on it highly don't bring no drama by me
it's deadly period pointblank slash kamikaze
the alpha and omega no doubt an innovator
in front of your bodega it's the style originator
you doubters and you haters ra bout to end your data
with writer's block i'm off the top without the pen no paper
the archaeologist let y'all acknowledge it
then i start the apocalypse then watch the god demolish it
i heard the news there's a dude they wanna hear from
take it from square one lace up them air ones
then bring the new commandments to the planets
for livin life in the hood and for the music fanatics
it's for dimes and dons and for my love of writing songs
when the club mic is on i'm on my justice cipher hold back
so where my goons at  stand up we right here
where my thugs at  stand up we right here
and all the ogs  stand up we right here
bounce for yourself homie make yourself be heard
but you don't have to dance play it cool and listen
cause you know what this is we give 'em the business
your crew is number 1 if not best and better
i ain't no joke i use to let the mic smoke
now i slam it when i'm done and make sure it's broke
when i'm gone no on gets on cause i won't let
nobody press up and mess up the scene i set
but think about it then you'll understand
i'm just an addict addicted to music
maybe it's a habit i gotta use it
even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
i hook a beat up convert it into hiphop form
write a rhyme in grafitti and every show you see me in
deep concentration cause i'm no comedian
jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
i treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
another enemy not even a friend of me
cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
competing cause i just put your mind on pause
and i complete when you compare my rhyme with yours
i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned
remember me  the one you got your idea from
but soon you start to suffer the tune'll get rougher
when you start to stutter that's when you had enough of
biting it'll make you choke you can't provoke
you can't cope you shoulda broke because i ain't no joke 
i got a question  it's serious as cancer
who can keep the average dancer
hyper as a heart attack nobody smilin
cause you're expressin the rhyme that i'm stylin
this is what we all sit down to write
you can't make it so you take it home break it and bite
use pieces and bits of all my hiphop hits
get the style down pat then it's time to switch
put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
then you figured you're ready for the neighborhood chores
a emcee don't even try to be
when you come up to speak don't even lie to me
you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate
then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me
so when you see me come up freeze
or you'll be one of those seven mc's
they think that i'm a new jack but only if they knew that
they who think wrong are they who can't do that
style that i'm doin they might ruin
patterns of paragraphs based on you and
your offbeat dj if anything he play
sound familiar i'll wait 'til e say
you can get a smack for this i ain't no joke 
i hold the microphone like a grudge
b'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
i hold a conversation cause when i invent
when i see you i'll kick a freestyle goin steadily
but whatever you do don't miss one
there'll be another rough rhyme after this one
before you know it you're followin and fiendin
waiting for the punchline to get the meanin
like before the middle of my story i'm tellin
nobody beats the r so stop yellin
save it put it in your pocket for later
no interruptions 'til the mic is broke
when i'm gone then you can joke
cause everything is real on a serious tip
keep playin and i get furious quick
and i'll take you for a walk through hell
feed your dome  then watch your eyeballs swell
guide you out of triple stage darkness
when it get dark again then i'ma spark this
microphone cause the heat is on you see smoke
and i'm finished when the beat is gone i'm no joke 
verse one
turn up the bass check out my melody hand out a cigar
i'm lettin knowledge be born and my name's the r
akim not like the rest of them i'm not on a list
that's what i'm sayin i drop science like a scientist
my melody's in a code the very next episode
has the mic often distortin ready to explode
i keep the mic in fahrenheit freeze mc's and make em colder
the listener's system is kickin like solar
as i memorize advertise like a poet
keep you goin when i'm flowin smooth enough you know it
but rough that's why the middle of my story i tell eb
verse two
so what if i'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as i sing
one of these for mc's so they don't have to scream
i couldn't wait to take the mic flow into it to test
then let my melody play and then the record suggest
that i'm droppin bombs but i stay peace and calm
any mc that disagree with me just wave your arm
and i'll break when i'm through breakin i'll leave you broke
drop the mic when i'm finished and watch it smoke
so stand back you wanna rap  all of that can wait
i won't push i won't beat around the bush
i wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
you might try but you can't get close to
because i'm number one competition is none
i'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall
i just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
you shouldn't have told me you said you control me
so now a contest is what you owe me
pull out your money pull out your cut
pull up a chair and i'ma tear shit up
so easily will i emcee
some bass and treble is moist scratchin and cuttin a voice
and when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
i wouldn't have came to set my name around the same weak shit
puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit
in a rhyme why waste time on the microphone
i take this more serious than just a poem
rockin party to party backyard to yard
now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods
verse three
the rhyme is rugged at the same time sharp
i can swing off anything even a string of a harp
just turn it on and start rockin mind no introduction
til i finish droppin science no interruption
when i approach i exercise like a coach
usin a melody and add numerous notes
with the mic and the rakim
it's a task like a match i will strike again
rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
put in order to pursue with the momentum except
i say one rhyme and i order a longer rhyme shorter
a pause but don't stop the tape recorder
verse four
i'm not a regular competitor first rhyme editor
melody arranger poet etcetera
extra events the grand finale like bonus
i am the man they call the microphonist
with wisdom which means wise words bein spoken
too many at one time watch the mic start smokin
i came to express the rap i manifest
stand in my way and i'll lead a  words protest
mc's that wanna be dissed they're gonna
be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
all they can go get is me a glass of moet
a hard time sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
i take 7 mc's put em in a line
and add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
well it'll take 7 more before i go for mine
and that's 21 mc's ate up at the same time
easy does it do it easy that's what i'm doin
no fessin no messin around no chewin
no robbin no buyin bitin why bother
this slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow
my unusual style will confuse you a while
if i was water i flow in the nile
so many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's
just because of a cause i have to pause
right after tonight is when i prepare
to catch another sucka duck mc out there
cos my strategy has to be tragedy catastrophe
and after this you'll call me your majesty
my melody
verse five
marley marl synthesized it i memorize it
eric b made a cut and advertised it
my melody's created for mc's in the place
who try to listen cos i'm dissin 
take off your necklace you try to detect my pace
now you're buggin over  off my rhyme like bass
the melody that i'm stylin smooth as a violin
rough enough to break new york from long island
my wisdom is swift no matter if
my momentum is slow mc's still stand stiff
i'm genuine like leather don't try to be clever
so eric b cut it easily
it's been a long time i shouldn't have left you
without a strong rhyme to step to
think of how many weak shows you slept through
time's up i'm sorry i kept you
thinking of this you keep repeating you miss
the rhymes from the microphone soloist
and you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon
as you hear it pump up the volume
dance wit the speaker 'till  you hear it blow
then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
it's a 4 letter word when it's heard  it control
your body to dance you got it soul
ditects the tempo like a red alert
reaches your reflex so let it work
when this is playing you can't get stuck wit
the steps so get set and i'm a still come up wit
a gift to be swift follow the leader the rhyme will go
def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
it can be done but only i can do it
for those that can dance and clap your hands to it
i start to think and then i sink
into the paper like i was ink
when i'm writing i'm trapped in between the lines
i escape when i finish the rhyme
i got soul
you got it 4x
i know you got soul
picture a mic the stage is empty
a beat like this might tempt me
to pose show my rings and my fat gold chain
grab the mic like i'm on soul train
but i'll wait 'cause i mastered this
let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
eric b break the sticks you got it
rakim will begin when you make the mix
i'll experiment like a scientist
you wanna rhyme you gotta sign my list
'cause i'm a manifest and bless the mic i hold
you want it next  then you gotta have soul
'cause if you ain't got it i'm a make an encore
take the mic make the people respond for
the r 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
if you wanna get on after me
think about it wait erase your rhyme
forget it and don't waste your time
'cause i'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
drop the mic you shouldn't be holding it
this is how it should be done
this style is identical to none
some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
so upset that i'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
i drip steam like a microphone fiend
eager to mc is my theme
i get hype when i hear a drum roll
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul
you got it 5x
i got soul you got it that's why i came
to teach those who can't say my name
first of all i'm the soloist the soul controller
rakim gets stronger as i get older
constant elevation causes expansion
i write my rhyme while i cool in my mansion
then put it on tape and in the city i test it
then on the radio the r's requested
you listen to it the concept might break you
'cause almost anyone can relate to
whoever's out of hand i'm give him handles
light 'em up blow 'em out like candles
or should i just let him melt
then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
i'm not bold just cuz i rock gold
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul
you got it 4x
now i'm a stop to see what you got
get off the mic before i get too hot
i want to see which posse can dance the best
it should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
now if your from uptown brooklyn bound
the bronx queens or long island sound
even other states come right and exact
it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
since you came here you have to show and prove
and do that dance until it don't move
'cause all you need is soul selfesteem will release
the rest is up to you rakim 'll say peace
you got it 10x
verse one
standing by the speaker suddenly i had this
fever was it me or either summer madness
cuz i just can't stand around
so i get closer and the closer i get the better it sound
my mind starts to activate rhymes collaborate
cuz when i heard the beat i just had to make
something from the top of my head
so i fell into the groove of the wax and i said
how could i move the crowd
first of all ain't no mistakes allowed
here's the instruction put it together
it simple ain't it but quite clever
some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
but weak ideas irritate my ears
is this the best that you can make
cuz if not and you got more i'll wait
but don't make me wait too long coz i'm a move on 
the dancefloor when they put something smooth on
so turn up the bass it's better when it's loud
cuz i like to move the crowd
move the crowd
verse two
imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar
it gets stronger everytime i hold a
microphone check the tone to get started
the line for the microphone is departed
so leave it up to me my dj is mixing
everyone is moving or eager to listen
your hands in the air your mouth shut
cuz i'm on the mic and eric b is on the cut
for those that know me indeed i like to flow
especially when the music's going slow
it gives me a chance to let everybody know
it's time to bust out the rakim show
i'm the intelligent wise on the mic i will rise
right in front of your eyes cuz i am a surprise
so i'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
all praise due to allah and that's a blessing
wit knowledge of self there's nothing i can't solve
at 360 degrees i revolve
this is actual fact it's not an act it's been proven
indeed and i proceed to make the crowd keep moving
move the crowd
 yo rakim what's up
 yo i'm doing the knowledge e i'm trying to get paid in full
 well check this out since nobry walters is our agency right
 true
 kara lewis is our agent
 word up
 zakia 4th  broadway is our record company
 indeed
 okay so who we rollin with
 we rollin with rush
 of rushtown management  check this out since we talking over
    this def beat that i put together i wanna hear some of them
    def rhymes know what i'm sayin  and together we can get
    paid in full
thinkin of a master plan
cuz ain't nuthin but sweat inside my hand
so i dig into my pocket all my money is spent
so i dig deeper but still comin up with lint
so i start my mission leave my residence
thinkin how could i get some dead presidents
i need money i used to be a stickup kid
so i think of all the devious things i did
i used to roll up this is a hold up ain't nuthin funny
stop smiling be still don't nuthin move but the money
but now i learned to earn cos i'm righteous
i feel great  so maybe i might just
search for a 9 to 5 if i strive
then maybe i'll stay alive
so i walk up the street whistlin this
feelin out of place cos man do i miss
a pen and a paper a stereo a tape of
me and eric b and a nice big plate of
fish which is my favorite dish
but without no money it's still a wish
cos i don't like to dream about gettin paid
so i dig into the books of the rhymes that i made
to now test to see if i got pull
hit the studio cos i'm paid in full
knowledge will begin until i finish this song
'cuz the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
you sweat as you step about to get hype
or should you just listen to the man on the mic
you're physically in this with me but how could you tell
if it's meant to be hiphop if you're not mentally as well
ready to absorb the rhyme that i just poured
into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored
if you just keep kickin' listen  to the mix
and think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
holds and controls you 'til i leave
you fall deeper in the style  it's hard to breathe
the only time i stop is when somebody drop and then
bring 'em to the front 'cuz my rhymes' the oxygen
then wave your hands  when you're ready i'll send you
into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue
and so on and i'ma go on simultaneously
and even if i stop  the rhyme remains to be
rising to the top  and i came to drop it
catch it and quiz it  is my topic
universual 'cuz i move everybody to come
by exercising your mind you'll coincide as one
you look around and see how packed the party starts to get
i draw a crowd  like an architect
the five borroughs react and all the islands attract
and every state can't wait  so they attack
off a spot on the floor  squeeze in cuz it's packed
it'll be more room if mc's play the back
i'm the r the a to the kim
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
the microphone fiend if i was a fake
whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes i make
i had you biting your tongue for what i brung and recite
sung it on stage some said it don't sound like
the voice on the record  i see what you mean
because the system was wack so i had to scream
so just  give me a mic if it's loud i'll blow it 
if not  into the crowd i'll throw it
pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well
before i let go i'ma spark your brain cells
i took time to write  tonight i will recite
so poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin
mc's are knowin' that's why they're goin
home to tell a friend when the party ends
cuz mic by mic and stage by stage
tape by tape and page by page
when the crowd is moving i compete with the mix
the rougher the cuts  the rougher the rhyme gets
deeper and deeper  i hope you understand it
i made it up myself and i planned it
for other mc's who waste time 
writing jokes riddles and maybe a rhyme
i cross my arms and i was waiting  but i was hating
the rappers on the microphone was fronting  just faking
they wasn't breakin' which means i was achin'
to get up on the microphone and then start takin'
control of the mic  uptight when i grabbed it
so hug the speaker your ear's a magnet
attracted to a freestyle put in effect
you listen to my man while you're sippin' moet
so eric pick up the needle yeah put it in the middle ahhight
give me a scratch turn my mic up a little
i want you to hear this perfectly clear
catch what i'm sayin' you get the idea
i hope you knowledge the beginning cuz i'm finished this song
the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on
i came in the door i said it before
i never let the mic magnatize me no more
but it's biting me fighting me inviting  me to rhyme
i can't hold it back i'm looking for the line
taking off my coat clearing my throat
my rhyme will be kicking it until i hit my last note
my mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
selfesteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
but still say a rhyme after the next one
prepared never scared i'll just bless one
and you know that i'm the soloist
so eric b make 'em clap to this
i don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
no tricks in '86 it's time to build
eric b easy on the cut no mistakes allowed
cuz to me mc means move the crowd
i made it easy to dance to this
but can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
saying indeed that i precede cuz my man made a mix
if he bleed he won't need no bandaid to fix
if they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
i hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
but he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
the party is live the rhyme can't be kept in
side it needs erupting just like a volcano
it ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
because i'm better then the rest of them
eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim
go get a girl and get soft and warm
don't get excited you've been invited to a quiet storm
but now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
and then you ask what have i done lately
first you said all you want is love and affection
let me be your angel and i'll be your protection
take you out buy you all kinds of things
i must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
you caught an attitude you need food to eat up
i'm scheming like i'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
you scream i'm lazy you must be crazy
thought i was a donut you tried to glaze me
funky
verse one 
 
follow me into a solo 
get in the flow  and you can picture like a photo 
music mixed mellow maintains to make
melodies for mc's motivates the breaks 
i'm everlastin i can go on for days and days 
with rhyme displays that engrave deep as xrays 
i can take a phrase that's rarely heard flip it 
now it's a daily word 
i can get iller than a killin bomb
but no alarm  rakim will remain calm 
selfesteem make me super superb and supreme 
but for a microphone still i fiend 
this was a tape i wasn't supposed to break 
i was supposed to wait but let's motivate 
i want to see who can keep followin and swallowin 
takin the making bitin it and borrowin 
brothers tried and others died to get the formula 
but i'ma let ya sweat  you still ain't warm
you a step away from frozen stiff as if ya posin 
dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen 
so follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first
let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe 
what could ya say as the earth gets further and further away 
planets are small as balls of clay 
astray into the milky way  world's outasight 
far as the eye can see  not even a satellite 
now stop and turn around and look 
as ya stare in the darkness ya knowledge is took 
so keep starin soon ya suddenly see a star 
you better follow it cause it's the r 
this is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
hurry hurry step right up and keep followin 
the leader 
 
verse two 
 
this is a lifetime mission vision of prison 
aight listen 
in this journey you're the journal i'm the journalist 
am i eternal or an eternalist 
i'm about to flow long as i can possibly go 
keep ya movin cause the crowd said so 
dance  cuts rip ya pants 
eric b on the blades bleedin to death  call the ambulance
pull out my weapon and start to squeeze 
a magnum as a microphone murderin' mc's 
let's quote a rhyme from a record i wrote 
follow the leader yeah  dope 
cause everytime i stop it seems ya stuck 
soon as ya try to step off ya selfdestruct 
i came to overcome before i'm gone 
by showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born 
then after that i'll live forever  you disagree 
you say never then follow me 
from century to century you'll remember me 
in history  not a mystery or a memory 
god by nature mind raised in asia 
since you was tricked i have to raise ya 
from the cradle to the grave but remember 
you're not a slave 
cause we was put here to be much more than that 
but we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped 
but i'm here to break away the chains take away the pains 
remake the brains reveal my name 
i guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous 
it can't be mixed diluted it can't be changed or switched 
here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing 
hurry hurry step right up and keep following 
the leader 
 
verse three 
 
a furified freestyle lyrics of fury 
my third eye makes me shine like jewelry 
you're just a rentarapper your rhymes are minutemaid 
i'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade 
i can't wait to break and eliminate 
on every traitor or snake  so stay awake 
and follow and follow because the tempo's a trail 
the stage is a cage the mic is a third rail 
i'm rakim the fiend of a microphone 
i'm not him so leave my mic alone 
soon as the beat is felt i'm ready to go 
so fasten your seatbelt cause i'm about to flow 
no need to speed slow down to let the leader lead 
word to daddy indeed 
the r's a rollin stone so i'm rollin 
directions is told then the rhymes are stolen 
stop buggin' a brother said dig em i never dug 'em 
he couldn't follow the leader long enough so i drug 'em 
into danger zone he should arrange his own
face it it's basic erase it change ya tone
there's one r in the alphabet 
it's a oneletter word and it's about to get 
more complex from one rhyme to the next 
eric b be easy on the flex 
i've been from state to state followers tailgate 
keep comin but you came too late but i'll wait 
so back up regroup get a grip come equipped 
you're the next contestant  clap ya hands you won a trip 
the price is right  don't make a deal too soon 
how many notes could you name this tune 
follow the leader is the title theme task 
now ya know you don't have to ask 
rap is rhythm and poetry cuts create sound effects 
you might catch up if you follow the records e wrecks 
until then keep eatin and swallowin 
you better take a deep breath and keep followin 
the leader
i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
music orientated so when hiphop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated
they tried to take it and say that i'm too small
cool 'cause i don't get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then i jet
back to the lab without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the other one then i make another one
to dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i don't need a cigarette know what i mean
i'm raging ripping up the stage and
don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
thought of cuz it's sort ofan addiction
magnatized by the mixing
vocals vocabulary your verses you're stuck in
the mic is a drano volcanoes erupting
rhymes overflowing gradually growing
everything is written in the cold so it can coin
cide my thoughts to guide
48 tracks to slide
the invincible microphone fiend rakim
spread the word 'cause i'm in
 effect
a smooth operator operating correctly
but back to the problem i gotta habit
you can't solve it silly rabbit
the prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
i fiend for a microphone like herion
soon as the bass kicks i need a fix
gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
and i'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness  beware it's the reanamator
a menace to a microphone a lethal weapon
an assasinator if the people ain't stepping
you see a part of me that you never seen
when i'm fiending for a microphone i'm the microphone fiend
verse 2
after 12 i'm worse that a gremlin
feed me hiphop and i start trembling
the thrill of suspense is intense your horrified
by any means neccesary this is what has to be done
make way 'cause here i come
my dj cuts material
grand imperial
it's a must that i bust any mic you're hand to me
it's inherited it's runs in the family
i wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's  back
if that don't slow 'em up i carry a full pack
now i don't want to have to let off you should of kept off
you didn't keep the stage warm step off
ladies and gentleman you're about to see
a pasttime hobby about to be
take it to the maximum i can't relax see i'm
hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one
hell of a antidote something you can't smoke
more than dope you're trying to move away but you can't you're broke
more than cracked up you should have backed up
for those who act up need to be more than smacked up
any entertainer i got a torture chamber
one on one and i'm the remainder
so close your eyes and hold your breath
and i'm a hit 'cha wit the blow of death
before you go you'll remember you seen
the fiend of a microphone i'm the microphone fiend
verse one
poets are paranoid dj's dstroyed
cuz i came back to attack others in spite
strike like lightnin' it's quite frightenin'
but don't be afraid in the dark in a park
not a scream or a cry or a bark more like a spark
ya tremble like a  alcoholic muscles tighten up
what's that lighten up you see a sight but
suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick
you grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick
music's the clue when i come your warned
apocolypse now when i'm done ya gone
haven't you ever heard of a mcmurderer
this is the death penaltyand i'm servin' a
death wish so come on step to this
hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
friday the thirteenth walking down elm street
you come in my realm ya get beat
this is off limits so your visions are blurry
all ya see is the meters at a volume 
pumping lyrics of fury
it's a fearified freestyle
terror in the styles never errorfiles
indeed i'm known your exiled
for those that oppose to be level or next to this
i ain't a devil and this ain't the exorcist
worse than a nightmare you don't have to sleep a wink
the pain's a migraine every time ya think
flashbacks interfere ya start to hear
the rakim in your ear
then the beat is hysterical
that makes eric go get a ax and chops the wack
soon the lyrical format is superior
faces of death remain 
mc's decaying cuz they never stayed
the scene of a crime every night at the show
the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
it's only one capable breaks the unbreakable
melodiesunmakable patternunecscapable
a horn if want the style i posses 
i bless the child the earth the gods and bomb the rest
for those that envy a mc it can be
hazardous to your health so be friendly
a matter of life and death just like a ethchasketch
shake 'till your clear make it disappear make the next
after the ceremony let the rhyme rest in peace
if not my soul'll release
the scene is recreated reincarnated updated i'm glad you made it
cuz your about to see a disasterous sight
a performance never again performed on a mic
lyrics of fury
a fearified freestyle
make sure the system's loud when i mention
phrases that's fearsome
you want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums
i sit back and observe the whole scenery 
then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
strictly business i'm quickly in this mood
and i don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
i'm a tear you apart but i'm a spare you a heart
program into the speed of the rhyme prepare to start
rhythm's out of the radius insane as the craziest
musical madness mc ever made see it's
now an emergency openheart surgery
open your mind you will find every word'll be
furier than ever i remain the furture
battle's temptingwhatever suits ya
for words the sentence there's no resemblance
you think you're ruffer then suffer the consequences
i'm never dyingterrifying results
i wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts
mictomouth resuscitation rhythm with radiation
novicane ease the pain it might save him
if not eric b's the judge the crowd's the jury
how do i plead to homicide
lyrics of fury
they're getting furier   a fearified freestyle
  put your hands together clap your hands
verse one rakim
this is for thousands of people who came
a show from road to road you're entertained
i don't even have to say my name
cause when the place is ripped in half i'm to blame
masses of posses packed up schemin
ladies lovely and keep on screamin
go rakim go rakim go
it won't be long then it's on with the show
i'm late so hit the brakes and park the benzito
double oh seven incognito
sneak in the back door lookin for the stage
when i get on you react in a rage
people from side to side and front to back
won't dance if the mc's wack
the crowd go psycho even if i don't move
some like the groove cause i'm so smooth
then somethin happens feet start tappin
you can't hold back when rakim's rappin
the man you've been waitin for rougher than ever
ladies and gentlemen put your hands together
  clap your hands
verse two rakim
i create em take em shake em then make em clap to this
most of you rappers can't even rap to this
i made it faster you tried to master
syncopated styles words flowin after
measures of metaphor definitions of more than one
take it both ways i'll be here when you're done
remember as the rhyme goes on it's rougher
soon as i stop you had enough of
followin footsteps you better turn back soon
sucker mc's suck rhymes like vacuums
the style remains the same the words is changed
bitten rewritten recited and rearranged
sing along if your tongue is strong it gets sore
sing when i'm gone and it'll break your jaw
wisdom flows so swift i'm asiatic
is it a gift or automatic
static i don't cling
i got a tip of my own and i don't sing
don't understand here's an example
and why mc's and dj's sample
cause we don't have a band it's just my voice and his hands
that's what hiphop was it still stands
the records we use are from mom's and pop's collection
find a break from a dope selection
and go to the store then buy one more
so my dj can mix cause that's what his hands are for
years later hiphop got contracts
the chance to put actual facts on wax
a mind's the coach the physical form's the team
the top's the destination i'm the cream
and still i rise with somethin pumpin and somethin clever
ladies and gentlemen put your hands together
  clap your hands clap em clap em
verse three rakim
now who's the man with the masterplan
with stacks of verbal attacks so clap your hands
rhyme written in graffiti xeroxed on blueprints
students influenced are now a nuisance
you couldn't fight it you had to clap to this
you got excited you almost snapped your wrist
the rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment
when i'm with this you can't toy with
the def jam juicer rough rhyme producer
loads of lyrics get you loose then looser
the man so smooth and world so rough
eric is throwin and sewin rippin restitchin the cuts
microphone your majesty no one's bad as me
seems the tragedy rakim had to be
thinkin of some def view of a video
visions are vicious and i'll let the city know
whoever's frontin they know nothin to say though
so lay low musical forms are kickin' like kato
don't get near it hard as you ever hear it
i know it's fearified but don't fear it
and try to predict which rhyme you can kick
you're quick to pick your best for the mic is lit
instead of goin with the flow like you're supposed to go
and enjoy the show and yo put your hands together
  clap your hands put your hands together
         clap your hands 
it's to the listeners whispered 4x
it's to the listener
repeat interlude and line 4x
it's to the listeners for those that have a ear for this
state of the art engineered for the mix
eardrums are playing along to what i'm sayin you're singin a song
stevie blass on the keyboard swingin along
but you don't have to dance play it cool and listen
my dj's mixin and i'll do the quizzin
cause who is number one if not best then better
here's a hint the 18th letter
the rhymes is sportable microphone is portable
for any immortal man swords is not affordable
never take a loss cause i'm hard to beat
i ain't cheap but don't sell me a dream i don't sleep
i'm paid in full so save the bull
this ain't a stickup you don't have to wave until
you feel sure and you want more then wipe your sweat
cause i just wanted to see how hype you could get
cause when i came in the door steppin hard enough to shake the floor
i just started but the others can't make no more
runnin out of beats breaks and out of time
if i was gone you'd be runnin out of rhymes
i prove records don't have to be long
if it's understood and the story is strong
you can speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners
the people is peep less it's to the listeners
i'm the lord for somethin you can absorb
try and control and be cautious but the cuts and the chords
make me deeper than down i make the crowd crowd around
people are peep less cause the soloist found
phrases thoughts made by the r of course
one thing i do is keep em different and far from yours
you keep talkin when will all the damage be done
you say you're rulin but when i'm in the place you don't come
maybe you're waitin to see what i'm makin
one more style gets taken then i'ma be breakin
if the patterns are causes piano is soft
but make it hard for you to start where i left off
you find yourself lost til the point is across
you hit reverse to rewind it that's when you hit the pause
i set the scene first you hear mixin
then the microphone fiend's in effect still listenin
pay close attention never before mentioned
listen up i got a brand new invention
made from a musician it's notes are played crisp
but listeners listen to what i wrote on a disc
copywritten but still bitten they almost sound like
almost pumpin but it ain't down like
a record's supposed to sound watch as it go around
records are broken smashed into the ground
that ain't my melody brothers keep runnin up and tellin me
others are trying to flow smooth and steadily
potholes are left in my path then i crash and bruise
whoever refuse and cruise right past em
cause i just left to do it for easy whatever
death till i get back you better stay in step
at the speakers you'll stare if i was there your description is
no competition

no competition

competition is none i remain at the top like the sun
and i burn whoever come in the chambers of torture
i caught ya you shoulda brought ya
neighborhood to support ya
no one in my path will withstand
under pressure the wrath of a swift man
you name the day the grounds to be neutral
speak your piece the feeling's mutual
we can go topic from topic whenever i drop it
try to stop it
in other words what the brother heard
he tried to catch it but what occurred
was too much weight for one brain to take
try to concentrate maintain then elevate
program an ounce from pound to pound
the matter of weight can't hold my mind down
permanent damage i do away with
no time for fun cause i don't play with
competitors there's only one when i'm done
competition is none

no competition

competition is none i'm the soul survivor
mc's get live but i get liver
it ain't a memorex live in concert
at every network the r the expert
whoever goes against causes friction
introduction music where's the mixing
ra will never die tools they never try
to beat or defeat me because whenever i
put poetry in motion
from the nile then out into the ocean
threefourths of water makes seven seas
a third of land threesixty degrees
i circulate and remain to rotate
seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate
be prepared whenever i come
competition is none

it's no competition

creator the alphabets let's communicate
when i translate the situation's straight
no dictionary's necessary to use
big words do nothing but confuse and lose
from the first step a concept was kept
to the end of the rhyme it get more indepth
all thoughts i come across my mind's the source
made by the r of course
seven holes in my face as i'm lookin out my window
speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows
through the speakers i hear it so pump this
and we can fill up the whole circumfrence
with competition on an impossible mission
comin up with nothin keep fishin
no runner up just lost or forfeits
they all get butterflies soon as the dog gets
unlocked lines for blocks and blocks
might be triflin to call the cops
bring along paramedics
but that won't help you not even calisthetics
i'm god g is the seventh letter made
rainin on rappers there's no parade
so if you ain't wise then don't even come
competition for this inter mixin is none

it's no competition

competition is none
whoever underestimated still waited
pumping the radio finally they played it
you wondered how come the album was late
i was giving you time to get the last one straight
the show must go on i got something to dance to
slow it down and romance to and give  me a chance to
keep you in tune and up to par
then you're doing it with the r
doing it wit the r
something new and to keep you doing what'cha doing
this is for you and your crew and for who in
the vicinity i don't need no identity
i see hands in the air that means many be
cooperating i can't stop relating
hiphop is making more sense when i'm stating
paragraphs of potential to prevent you
from using my instrumental keep in mind i meant to
illustrate another iller break immediately
hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me
then soon you're in tune and up to par
and then you're doing it wit the r
keep doing it you keep doing it wit the r
in the summertime pockets bulging
somethings's happening then i'm indulging
music is mine gucci seats reclined
gold grill a paint job will shine
pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
turn up the bass and let the system thump
a block party starts to form people start to swarm
loud as a ghetto blaster word is bond
records remind you of a madness
the moment it's played you get gladdest
the return of the brother keeping you up to par
and you're doing it wit the r
shout outs
how could i keep my composure
when all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure
release then veins in the brains increase
when i let off make a wish and blow the smoke off my piece
unloadin unfold and the rhymes are explodin
and the mic that im holdins golden
cordless cause the wire caught fire like a fuse
gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction
the outcome is there so listen
here's the brief description
a boom then flame then smoke ashes a dust to dust
contact is compact when i bust
mc's are now in a massacre
a disaster a master at fashion a beat to death
to a pulp till it can't pump
speakers aint sayin nothin
now the ball can thump
as i'm lookin' i stand like great buildings in brooklyn
then the stage is took then
havoc struck that could product a whole court
keep in touch with the mic when you're holdin y'all
sumpin and pumpin and slobbin and droolin
nothin's pumpin who do you think ya foolin
tommy tucker the neighborhood sucker
what you oughtta do is pick up a tempo
from what i invent so hard not to bite but you can't prevent so
you start to kidnap
i watch the kid rap
when he get off he know he shouldn't a did that
minor oldtimer weakrhymer stayinliner
you won't be inclined to go so yo
maybe later you're gonna be
but for now you're almost one of me
now the immature imitations taken from originations
made by tracin and a little arrangin
so perform if ya still aint warm maybe after
a roast by the host with the most it's a musical massacre
never tired don't even try it keep quiet
like a storm you could rainbut a riot
remains the gangs power just like the towerin inferno
the beat's gonna burn so
distance i kept ou better watch your step
volunteers go from here and get
ya out of the flames
appreciate the temperature change
anywhere within the range of celcius
fahrenheit on the mic mic melts see it
burns soon as it's felt see it's torchin scorchin
mic's pipin hot steamin who's schemin now ya not
james brown must a been dusted
disgusted now he can't be trusted
embalmed with fluid
static can cause an explosion in fact impact's closin in
time was up so i don't need a time bomb
beat gives me a heatstroke when i rhyme calm
pull out the tool sometimes i wanna break fool
but i was cool like one in the chamber
lets play a game of rhymin roulette
and put me up to your brain and name a rhyme about ya clout
one mistake ya out
if this imitation it can't be the same show
maybe what you'll find somewhere over the rainbow
courage heart brain you need rhyme
turn on your mic snap your fingers three times
we gone or the story won't end the same
and you'll feel the flame
the potion was weak make another antidote
whats the science why can't ya quote
elements for musical intelligence
rhymes are irrelevant no development
and that settles it
go manufacture a match send me after a blast
let the rhythm hit 'em
i'm the arsenal
i got artillery lyrics of ammo
rounds of rhythm
then i'm 'a give 'em piano
bring a bulletproof vest
nothin' to ricochet
ready to aim at the brain
now what the trigger say
tempos triflin'
felt like a rifle
massage 'n' melodies
might go right through
simultaneously like an uzi
nothin' can bruise me
lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
so reload quickly
and you better hit me
while i'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
you steppin' with 0 0 7
better make it snappy
no time to do your hair baby
brothers are bustin' at me
beats and bullets pass me
none on target
they want the r hit
but wtch the god get
quicker the tongue is the trigger
'cause i'm real fast
let off some rhythm at 'em
let 'em feel the blast
penetrate at a crazy rate
this ain't no 38
hit 'em at point blank range
and watch 'em radiate
runnin' out of ammunition
i'm done wit' em
you ask me how i did 'em 
i let the rhythm hit 'em
i push a power that's punishable
better be a prisoner
the hit man is the
brother wit' charisma
showing you that i have
powerful paragraphs
followers will become leaders
but without a path
ya mentally paralyzed
crippled ya third eye
rhymes are blurred
then it occurred that you heard i
reduced the friction with crucifixion
let loose the mix then
boost the piston
eric hit 'em with' some of that
cut like a lumberjack
and me gettin' hit back
it won't be none of that
i'm untouchable
you see me in 3d
when i let the rhythm hit another mc
lyrics made of lead
enters your head
then eruptions of a mass production
will spread when
music is louder
full of gunpower
microphone machinery
when i see a crowd of
party people pumpin'
their fist like this
ya hide in the back
thinkin' that i might miss
but the r is accurate
plus i'm packed up with 
educated punch lines that
i have to hit
whatever i aim at
i line 'em up
ya body is weak feel with pain
that time is up
you been hit with somethin'
different isn't it
rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
nothin' can harm me
why try to bar me
you couldn't come around to rob with a army
you'll get wrecked by the architect
so respect 'em
i disconnect 'em soon as i inject 'em
with radiation
put 'em by the basement
bust his chest open
bash his face in
let it split 'im
since he brought his main man wit' 'im
he ask me how i did 'im
i let the rhythm hit 'im
let it hit 'im
dance floor's dangerous
packed in like a briefcase
rhyth with ral rough rhyme
beats with deep bass
girls with tight pants
maybe they might dance
tonight if the rs on the mike
there's a slight chance
the crowd is crucial
mc's grounds are neutral
now that you're here let me introduce you
get ready
i'm hard read like graffiti but steady
science i drop is real heavy
radiant energy that'll be the penalty
touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
the prescription's one every hour
now it's a havoc
if ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
attention follow directions real close
keep out of reach of children
beware of overdose
too many milligram
but what made a iller jam
my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
that kill a man
i deas for the ear to fear
might split 'im
he'll never forget 'im
he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
at least when he left he'll know what hit 'im
the last breath of the words of death
was the rhythm
now throw you hands in the air and yo go
rakim will do the rest of this slow
if i speed they know you'll blow the hell up
if i slow up catch up hell no
wicked as i kecked it
don't need to remix it
'cause i prefixed it
reversed and switched it
to perform to perfection
section for section
rhymes keep connectin'
ya guessin' what's next an'
blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'cause when i explained ya can't complain for pain
travel through the brain hit a vein
then remain let it radiate
vibes will vibrate
why did you violate
now i'm 'a have to let the style brak
moans now the tone is ingrown
after this here's thrown gimme another microphone
before i get that fifi i met
whisper i wanna reach your intellect
kiss her 'cause i wanna give her the most respect
so i shine and let the write reflect
hold 'er mold 'er make 'er feel older
lay her on my shoulder
eeverything i told her
makes her feel secure whenever i'm wit' 'er
and you know how i did 'er
me and the rhythm hit 'er
i'm the alpha with no omega
beginning without the end so play the
eye inside no extended version
next episode be smooth as a persian
rhyme everlastin there'll be no part two
knowledge is infinite once i start to draw
a better picture for your third eye if you're blind
you know with a mic i'm a black michaelangelo
i'm the brother who ideas are colorful
givin em insight but givin em trouble to
comprehend cause they thoughts won't blend in
they're pretendin while i'm extendin
you bite like a parasite  you attacks
but you won't strike cause you ain't no match
you need more light cause yours got dim
then you get sparked by the lord rakim
what's the matter g check your battery
go get charged up then come battle me
you try hard and die hard you ain't eveready
when they check the pulse you'll be dead as freddie
shop in sears for new ideas
check your engine and ask your engineers
to equalize try to disguise it
if that don't work yo then monosize it
you need more power better bring battlecat
but this ain't grayskull and you ain't rippin jack
don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley
we can go rhyme for rhyme til the mic stop the workin
then i'ma leave you behind the iron curtain
and you'll remain backstage
your book is over i ripped your last page
changed the endin at least you went out rappin
now i'ma tell em what happened
i filled the mic with explosives and lit it up
it was too heavy to hold he couldn't pick it up
pass the mic let him try to get paid
he hit the stage it went off like a hand grenade
now scrape him off the floor and off my list
i ain't a soloist i'm an arsonist
sprayed up he said he was gonna do what
played up mc grand but poohbutt
stole his lady and drove her crazy
you asked me why  cause her man tried to play me
i sent her back a nervous wreck
and tried to put her back in check
my speciality is masterin the female species
i specialize in her until she sees
where i come from and why i came
i tame the train til she manifest my name
fill her with life until she burst with energy
then leave her restless cause a lot of women be
tryin to drain us and leave us stripped dry
put holes in our pocket but you ain't that fly
i clipped your wings and bring you down to earth
and tell you what life is worth
it ain't rings and things that's materialistic
you wanna pip on imperialist with
food for thought cause i'm the shelter
i'll be your clothes keep you warm and help ya
not to be hot to trot by a haunt
and why do y'all got to flaunt
cool i heat you up like a black mink coat
hug your neck like a fat gold rope
words i speak and my dj's cuts will warm ya ears
like mink earmuffs
so eric show em how fast your hands 'll go
so the people in the stands'll know
that you don't scratch your cuts in the grave
moves in waves to my rhyme displays
float evoke my tempo jets
expressions express when you kick steps
keep em energetic so let it
pound in your head til what i said is embedded
don't forget it's copastetic set it
anywhere you want your poetry's pathetic
you gets no credit til you get it straight
let's motivate
no intermissions cause it ain't commercial
if you wanna break then i'll reimburse you
i won't let go so my mic won't drop cause
vocabs is endless vocals exist
rhyme goes on so no one can stop this
especially when i start to say the
rhymes with no omega
no omega
planet earth was my place of birth
born to be the soul controller of the universe
besides the part of the map i hit first
any environment i can adapt when it gets worst
the rough gets goin the goin gets rough
when i start flowin the mic might bust
the next state i shake from the power i generate
people in cali used to think it was earthquakes
cause times was hard on the boulevard
so i vote god and never get scarred and gauled
but it seems like i'm locked in hell
lookin over the edge but the r never fell
a trip to slip cause my nikes got grip
stand on my own two feet and come equipped
any stage i'm seen on or mic i fiend on
i stand alone and need nothin to lean on
going for self with a long way to go
so much to say but i still flow slow
i come correct and i won't look back
cause it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
i learn to relax in my room and escape from new york
and return through the womb of the world as a thought
thinkin how hard it was to be born
me bein cream with no physical form
millions of cells with one destination
to reach the best part as life's creation
nine months later a job well done
make way cause here i come
since i made it this far i can't stop now
there's a will and a way and i got the knowhow
to be all i can be and more
and see all there is to see before
i'm called to go back to the essence
it's a lot to learn so i study my lessons
i thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
i'm glad i listened when my father was rappin to me
cause back in the days they lived in caves
exiled from the original man they strayed away
now that's what i call hard times
i'd rather be here to exercise the mind
then i take a thought around the world twice
from knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
across the desert that's hot as the arabian
but they couldn't cave me in cause i'm the asian
reachin for the city of mecca visit medina
visions of nefertiti then i seen a
mind keeps traveling i'll be back after
i stop and think about the brothers and sisters in africa
return the thought through the eye of a needle
for miles i thought and i just brought the people
under the dark skies on a dark side
not only there but right here's an apartheid
so now is the time for us to react
take a trip through the mind and when you get back
understand your third eye seen all of that
it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
no more props i want property in every borough
nobody's stoppin me because i'm thorough
rhymes i make gimme real estate for me to own
wherever i bless a microphone
doubleohseven is back and relaxin
on point and reactin and ready for action
i'm so low key that you might not see me
incognito and takin it easy ghetto
quiet as kept on a hush hush
in front of a crowd i get loud there's a bum rush
be calm keep a low pro and play the background
hopin the whack rapper put the mic back down
so rip it break it in half go 'head and slam it
cause when it's time to build i'm a mechanic
of bondin and mendin attachin and blendin
so many solos there is no endin
people in my neighborhood they know i'm good
from london to hollywood wherever i stood
footprints remain on stage ever since
sidewalks and streets i leave fossils and dents
when i had sex i left my name on necks
my trademark was left throughout the projects
i used to get rich when i played clo
so i collect my cash then slide
i've got my back my gun's on my side
it shouldn't have to be like that
i guess it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
i'm from the ghetto
word up
see if you can step to this

and make sure the pace is kept
and this ain't as smooth as i'ma get
nice and easy but hard to catch on to
move with melodies rhymes to respond to
the mic's in front of me so you know it's gonna be
rough and rugged plus i'm smooth as i wanna be
i'm somethin like sippin on dom perignon
so absorb the song til the rhyme's all gone
my beats and speech original you can't find these
eightynine is mine so is the nineties
tellin you what you need to know and more
you're unsure  on tour i explore
from street to street to speak from beat after beat
my cypher's complete when i build with people i meet
so here's the info straight from the source in fact
paid the cost to be the boss step back
give me room to exercise the mind
threehundred and sixty degrees'll be fine
the weight of the world is what we hold
that's a six followed by twentyone zeroes
six sex shit sums is a lot of weight
my truth is the strength and my thought won't break
what it take concentration to rebuild our
nation but we got to have mind power
and we can make it work because i know we can
and if somethin go wrong make another plan
it's up to us so strive and be wise and
when we reach the top don't stop risin
and i'll keep comin up with more of
the most requested songs that you all love
reach out and touch the mic take control
still gettin paid and i still got soul
and the only thing i ever wanted you to follow was poetry
mind takes xrays so listen closely
from the darkness came the light clear out of a dark night
now i'm here to spark the mic
send out truth for other groups and substitutes
with runon rhymes and weak dubs and loops
they'd rather hear the arsonist they insist
no need to reminisce see if you can step to this
step back
 eric b cuts up the phrase 
so just step
 eric b cuts up the phrase 
just step the rhymes create energy
charged up by the cut and it's sendin me
for a trip through the mind so i can locate
a laid back rap at a slow rate
it ain't hard at all cause i invented it
as the days go on you hear them with it
brother bustin braincells thinkin of a rap
with the same old style we had enough of that
we all need somethin to step to
and don't forget to cause i won't let you
dance without hopin that this come on next
and if it go off the dj can't flex
cause here's the tempo i'ma regulate the pace
here's the step go find some space
and what we gonna do is in unison kick
shake your head you're influenced with music
by now you're intoxicated cause i prove i made it
the pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated
from side to side you pause and clap
but if you came to rap step back
 eric b cuts up the phrase 
run for cover
here i go again ready to flow again 
better hold my mic don't blow again
warned by alarms when the mic gets warm 
crowd'll get critical can't keep calm
jet for the exit why hang around
words that i found make the mic melt down
if you stay better cooperate cuz i amputate
and whoever don't break i'ma suffocate
leave 'em with asthma you better pass the
mic to the massacre master who has the
power to build and destoy at the same time
so track the wack at the right and exact could shine 
meant to beat overheat but i won't stop
so evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
switch it from one hand to another
and that's a hint my brother run for cover
cuz i'm armed my brain contains a bomb
as if i escaped from vietnam
some people label me lethal lyrics i made then put beats to
format collapse your lungs twist your tongues
you can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
words that i made'll create an iller scene
eric b is the fly human being on the guillotine
hook 'em up to a respirator cuz it's the mista suffocator
what i write is like shovin' a mic down your windpipe
don't let him bit rhymes rakim write
no mictomouth resuscitation is neccessary
no obituary and if they're left they're buried
as it strikes on the same mic twice and then
cut it on and i'ma strike again
i meditate off the breaks till the place shakes
then i make rain hail snow and earthquakes
speak the truth tear the roof off the mother
the stage is stompin' grounds  run for cover
        scratching
evacuate the building danger cuz i came to explain the
strategy that'll be tragic automatically
havin' me to cause another catastrophe
all you gotta do is give rakim the
buildings collapsin' rappers gettin' trapped in
areas closed off no one gets back in
so set up roadblocks barracade the doors
fade put a detour sign on the stage
hold my microphone as evidence the weapon i use and been usin' ever since
the days in the park when rap was an art then
plus i was dominant determined and darkskinned
makin' it hard to walk the streets at night 
for those who talk the weak beats on the mic
whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage
prepare to be bumrushed when i yell charge
surround by sound of the beatdown another brother
this is stompin' grounds run for cover
wheels or foot better not stay put
whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
then you've got seven minutes to vacate the premises
lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
don't act wild single file to the door
no need for an encore just clear the floor
cuz my mic's about to self destruct
the stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
so make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
cuz minutes from now it won't be standin'
then send out and apb all poets beware of a brother like me
now how many rhymes could your man manufacture
how many bitin' mcs can i capture
trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
take over their route play 'em out like a cub scout
so leave troopin' for mcs at war 
and if it's a battle let the crowd keep score
cuz me and the drummer make drama and that's word to motherrun for cover
        scratching
this is poetry in motion
try to catch on stay close to the host
and mc's try to make the road rough but i'm coastin
ladies hear the rhymes rub em on like lotion
hit spots soothin can't stop movin
go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet i'm still coolin
when i detain it's a brainstorm
never the same form every brain i rained on is warm
takin a trip through memory lane to melody
see if you could tell if these thoughts to fell mc's
could do you justice but you can't touch this
some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed
i'm universal and much more merciful
so versatile with the style it's reversable
i get away even if i say a curse or two
first let me bust another verse for you
your arms too short to box with ra so quit
you don't want no kind of conflict
or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped
pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah i'm hip
everything i said flows since my intro
i plant a thought extend and then grow
holdin my pen tightly it might be
controversy at first when i write the
chords of research don't just take it for granted
when i'm gone my mind remains a planet
if i keep buildin and teach the children
so when they read in between the lines it's filled in
i break to meditate not a peep concentrate
till i'm deep awake but not asleep
at the same time risin and advertisin
what is true keep advised and you can stay wise
and i'm untouchable
comin over the bridge take a peak at the skyline
cause that's how i shine not only when i rhyme
my culture's makin me stronger mentally
physically i'm powerful poetry now that could be
labelled as art placed in a museum
style'll make scenery now you see 'em
exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with
nothin illiterate it's facts i build with
my mind's untouchable which means intangible
contents never dense it's understandable
i study life so i can live it the right way
no time to hear what another brother might say
why sell a capsule of crack i don't have to
i rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to
put message on records that's graced with hard bass
smugglin microphones this ain't scarface
whoever talked that talk i wanna hawk
and don't try to escape from new york
cross a 110th street lookin for a problem
it's hell up in harlem watch ra solve em
i hear the music clear as i get near
the hundred and twenty fifth street apollo theater
take a step back when i rap i step up to you
i'm untouchable
put on my thinking cap pump the track
test your reflex relax but in contact
you fold and lose control so hold your partner closer
you're supposed to keep your composure
but you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype
it's like nitro opponents get petro
remember the trademark left by the r
that's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest
in effect you could dietect the imposter
takin my props rakim is still proper
i'm a prophet you can't stop it when i drop it
everything i say coincide with the topic
thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured
inside my brain it's all manufactured
as we go deeper it's hard to find
don't even think about it cause you can't read my mind
it's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined
in the mind with some kind of idea for
the style i'm advertisin what is true
keep advised that you stay wise and the mind
is untouchable
verse one
me and eric b was coolin' at the paladium
sorry if you're in a rush  don't let me hold ya up
or interveen or interrupt but  
you got the look  i wanna get to know ya better
i had to let her know  but yo i didn't sweat her
'cause if you woulda seen what i was seein'
almost looked korean but european
when she spoke her accent was selfexplanatory 
even her body language told the story
her name was mahogony  twin's name was ebony
so we could talk and see new york
show time doesn't start until one o'clock
and once i entered your mind i wouldn't wanna stop
caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
calm ya nerves massage ya brain
each mic is a mineral poetry's protein
verse is a vitamin  affects like codeine
so tell me how you feel and i'll reveal 
a pill that'll heal ya pain  'cause i'm real
she must have od'd 'cause she couldn't resist
she spoke slowly when she told me this she said
chorus
over me she's goin' crazy
she'll rub me on my chest and call me mr sexy
she said she'd have my kids and help me make my next g
tell me i ain't finesse mahogony   
verse two
so i prescribed her something to revive
and surprise her she's liver and much more wiser
than the light i shine when my brain cells spark
come to me so we can glow in the dark
and soon you can represent the moon
as long as i keep ya in tune
i'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
it's funny  how time flies when ya havin' fun
we got close and it was almost one
she kissed me slow but you know how far a kiss can go
fck around and miss the show
so i told her to hold that thought real tight
we can finish where we left off later on tonite
back to the scene of the crime on time
as they introduced the 'fiend of the rhyme'
she stood with a birdseye view of me
thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
the back of the room i could see her eyes gloom
patient but hopin' that the show was over soon
as the place was ripped in half she made her way to the front row
i packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
the speakers were blown plus my mic was sore
besides i got places to go ladies to see
and she could tell me how crazy she was over me
we drove off  she said she liked the way that i performed
and couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm' i said
looks i received made it hard to mc
i can take a hint so i knew that she
showed her some sights then i took her to the condo
she was pipin' hot but i kept my calm so
she asked how come i don't smile
as we reached the kingdom she said bring some
champagne she'll entertain then sing some
sentimental songs real gentle 
it hit the spot and you know where it went to
as we embraced i felt her heart pumpin'
i knew she was in the mood for somethin'
so i laid on my back and relaxed
it wasn't the perignon that made her collaspe
over me
me and the rap's laid back
nonchalant and relaxed in the track
put together well so it ain't hard to tell
easy to recognize so my records'll sell
on the microphone well known with a low tone
show and prove when the stage show is shown
all you hear is screams when i'm hit by the laser beams
ladies fiend rappers are choosin up teams
so who could beat up just before we meet up
before i kick a rhyme i kick my feet up
to let you know everything's under control
under surveillance takin over your soul
so let me handle this gettin scandalous
all my jams are hits never plan to miss
crowd is captured released at my permission
peep em as i keep em eager to listen
opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down
left with a little sight ears still hear the sound
try to clear your mind but it's still there
give him about a year then give him a wheelchair
i damage and deteriorate til your brain dead
no huss cuss what i discuss'll bust his head
here's some hearin aids when your eardrums fail
you get scars so you could read it in braille
close your third eye then i do body work
and i keep the same procedure til somebody's hurt
my dj'll sew up cuts like an md
and i still move crowds like an mc
entertain and tear you out of your frame
leave you in a puddle of blood then let it rain
then i get deep so try to withstand
on my level to think or sink like quicksand
he couldn't hang so i cut the rope short
watchin em fall cause they need more support
this is the way that i done all of my competition
peep em as i keep em eager to listen
keep em eager to listen
the performance i give em is somethin like a hypnotism
swingin back and forth til you can keep the rhythm
at the tone of my voice you will become
eager to listen dance in a trance til you see the
r on stage no cheers all ears
all three of your eyes on me so it appears
just like you thought it would be but even better
live and direct on stage instead of the
radio or video or studio rehearsin
i'm at my best in the flesh in person
the main attraction center of attention
the crowd'll go crazy soon as i mention
it's time to communicate so let's conversate
i get my point across when you respond i make sense
so now we could continue the mission
as i keep em eager to listen
i used to always say one day
i'll play in the nba cause i'll slay
opponents well and also excel
as a black quarterback in the nfl
i throw to score so i can hear the crowd roar
keep em out of they seats and on the floor
and when i win it'll pump my adrenaline
my record is undefeated and i'll win again
i'll never lose or hear boos from the audience
cause they participate and applaud me since
i bring em what they want to hear
and they'll fill up the atmopshere
with people that came to party and have a good time
so when i'm gone i'm sure you understood the rhyme
because i promise to accomplish the mission
i came to set em straight and let em know
whoever's holdin the best just let him go
cause here's the inside scoop on the fiend
they wanna know why i'm seldom seen
cause who needs the tv screens and magazines
or shootin through the city in fly limousines
there's one thing i don't like it's the spotlight
 cause i already got light
because my schedule is tight i gotta write
i'm deep in the archives and keepin em hyped
it's been a long time since you heard a strong rhyme
none of these are weak so when you bite on mine
we can trace the hits and then name that style
mc'sll be out of a job for a while
i reposess your indentification
so hand in your application
put your mic on strike until you're unemployed
contract is up and i'm stampin it void
your selection ain't that selective
so i'ma put you in your proper perspective
on the dancefloor and doin the shake
ready to let em brake set em straight
somebody said i set em up and pulled the plug on em
but instead i let em go on so i could bug on em
go 'head and flow cause i close the show
swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow
for instance once i commence
 the crowd is convinced
so now you know who to put your money on
hurry up before your money's gone
cause i'm the most common denominator
orchestrate a rhyme much greater
i'm like a world almanac so tell the media
givin em information like encyclopedia
so bring a dictionary so you can look it up
so you know what i mean when i hook it up
no misconceptions although i complicate
but this concept'll set em straight
they even said that i was locked in jail
so now i guess i'm out on bail
the only island i was on was the strong one
and if i did my bid it'll be a long one
cause if i sold weight i'd be upstate
in the penile waitin for a brake
cause sellin drugs is for handicaps
i got too many skills besides bustin rough raps
if i go to jail it won't be for sellin ki's
it'll be for muderin mc's
the beat'll take over your heart then i start
to cut em in half cause rhymes are razor sharp
secure the exits all mc's remain
cause we got a crowd to entertain
and i know when i go i'll flow dangerous
brain'sll bust what you tryin to explain to us
you got lost and couldn't go on
came up short so here's one to grow on
elevate off a high iq
in time you'll find i'm true
cause once i start on a piece of art
from sun to moon and light to dark i build the ark
now you can float off the rhymes i wrote
i'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat
you could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked
attacked with a torpedo what did you expect
driftin up the creek without a beat or a paddle
castaway on a raft and stand fragile
rescue your crowd which ain't a hard job
me and my knowledge put together i'm a lifeguard
dealin with actual facts it sold out fat
here and now but i go so far back
to bring you up to date so we can elevate
it's no time to wait or anticipate
cause i'm never late i'm gonna motivate
let the rhythm hit 'em
i'm the arsenal
i got artillery lyrics of ammo
rounds of rhythm
then i'm 'a give 'em piano
bring a bulletproof vest
nothin' to ricochet
ready to aim at the brain
now what the trigger say
tempos triflin'
felt like a rifle
massage 'n' melodies
might go right through
simultaneously like an uzi
nothin' can bruise me
lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
so reload quickly
and you better hit me
while i'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
you steppin' with 0 0 7
better make it snappy
no time to do your hair baby
brothers are bustin' at me
beats and bullets pass me
none on target
they want the r hit
but wtch the god get
quicker the tongue is the trigger
'cause i'm real fast
let off some rhythm at 'em
let 'em feel the blast
penetrate at a crazy rate
this ain't no 38
hit 'em at point blank range
and watch 'em radiate
runnin' out of ammunition
i'm done wit' em
you ask me how i did 'em 
i let the rhythm hit 'em
i push a power that's punishable
better be a prisoner
the hit man is the
brother wit' charisma
showing you that i have
powerful paragraphs
followers will become leaders
but without a path
ya mentally paralyzed
crippled ya third eye
rhymes are blurred
then it occurred that you heard i
reduced the friction with crucifixion
let loose the mix then
boost the piston
eric hit 'em with' some of that
cut like a lumberjack
and me gettin' hit back
it won't be none of that
i'm untouchable
you see me in 3d
when i let the rhythm hit another mc
lyrics made of lead
enters your head
then eruptions of a mass production
will spread when
music is louder
full of gunpower
microphone machinery
when i see a crowd of
party people pumpin'
their fist like this
ya hide in the back
thinkin' that i might miss
but the r is accurate
plus i'm packed up with 
educated punch lines that
i have to hit
whatever i aim at
i line 'em up
ya body is weak feel with pain
that time is up
you been hit with somethin'
different isn't it
rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
nothin' can harm me
why try to bar me
you couldn't come around to rob with a army
you'll get wrecked by the architect
so respect 'em
i disconnect 'em soon as i inject 'em
with radiation
put 'em by the basement
bust his chest open
bash his face in
let it split 'im
since he brought his main man wit' 'im
he ask me how i did 'im
i let the rhythm hit 'im
let it hit 'im
dance floor's dangerous
packed in like a briefcase
rhyth with ral rough rhyme
beats with deep bass
girls with tight pants
maybe they might dance
tonight if the rs on the mike
there's a slight chance
the crowd is crucial
mc's grounds are neutral
now that you're here let me introduce you
get ready
i'm hard read like graffiti but steady
science i drop is real heavy
radiant energy that'll be the penalty
touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
the prescription's one every hour
now it's a havoc
if ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
attention follow directions real close
keep out of reach of children
beware of overdose
too many milligram
but what made a iller jam
my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
that kill a man
i deas for the ear to fear
might split 'im
he'll never forget 'im
he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
at least when he left he'll know what hit 'im
the last breath of the words of death
was the rhythm
now throw you hands in the air and yo go
rakim will do the rest of this slow
if i speed they know you'll blow the hell up
if i slow up catch up hell no
wicked as i kecked it
don't need to remix it
'cause i prefixed it
reversed and switched it
to perform to perfection
section for section
rhymes keep connectin'
ya guessin' what's next an'
blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'cause when i explained ya can't complain for pain
travel through the brain hit a vein
then remain let it radiate
vibes will vibrate
why did you violate
now i'm 'a have to let the style brak
moans now the tone is ingrown
after this here's thrown gimme another microphone
before i get that fifi i met
whisper i wanna reach your intellect
kiss her 'cause i wanna give her the most respect
so i shine and let the write reflect
hold 'er mold 'er make 'er feel older
lay her on my shoulder
eeverything i told her
makes her feel secure whenever i'm wit' 'er
and you know how i did 'er
me and the rhythm hit 'er
i seen her in the subway on my way to brooklyn
hello good looking is this seat tooken
on the atrain picking at her brain
i couldn't get her number i couldn't get her name
i said  i still like your style of fashion
but i hate your hostile 'itty attitude wit a passion
is it because brothers like to hawk alot
is it because your sign don't talk alot
she turned away no play i said ok
you don't really look good i hope you have a bad day
sat back relaxed though the ride was tight
i was thinking of the rhymes i wrote last night
next stop was mine a familar scene
i was meeting my friend killer ben in ft green
where the girls are real they tell ya how they feel
if you're soft you're soft or if you're hard like steel
see i don't bend and i won't rust
and i don't break and i won't bust
stomped up the street and did i hear a treat
hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
i took a peek it was the girl from the train behind me
did she live in the area was she trying to find me
hm i didn't wanna play myself out
i played it off stopped and i bought a guiness stout
now was she shy she didn't walk by
she came in the store then she even said hi
curiosity at a high velocity
maybe possibly she had the hots for me
i said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
i'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
if you hide your feelings and they hard to find
i wanna know what's on your mind
chorus
i said yo can i speak to um she said no
hey yo i know i didn't call i didn't wanna stress you
go out my way to impress you press to undress you
see i wanna get to know you so i can show you
what a strong relationship can grow to
but you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
squeeze the phone and hug me use your mind to rub me
now how does it feel when my mental massage ya temple
telephone's hot from the vibes that i sent you
now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
next you see ectacy's explosions
now i'm coming to see you to spend some time
i'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime
and if you hide your feelings and they hard to find
i wanna know what's on your mind
now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
i'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
so we met in queens and went to valley streams
and uh couldn't remember the movie we just seen
but it's wednesday take the train uptown
how do the 125th street sound
amateur night showtime at the apollo
probably be watching bill cosby tomorrow
then after that get into it i mean intimate
every word is an instrument
making sounds and tones and songs and moans
my lips so close to your ear it's like headphones
you smile you said you never know what the day will bring
it's always a new song to sing
the next day i went back to the her rest
knocked on the door intentions  finesse
she let me in and had nothing but a neglige on
smelling like liz claiborne
i sat down and got comfortable and watched the huxtables
she sat next to me and said what's up wit you
i got the feeling for sexual healing
a mental healing   how you feeling
she caught the effect and said she feel the same
could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
desire's yearning the fire's burning
you hot 'cause it's alot you're learning
now i'm ready to explore you inner world
it's take a long time cuz i'm just beginning girl
take it easy cut off the tv
cut off the lights use your mind to see me
use your physical form if i'm hard to find
'cause now i know what's on your mind
no more time to pass time 'cause these are the last rhymes
'cause we're living in the last times
they wanna go to war more wars to come
but most of us fight more wars than one
discrimination in the racial nation
while they destroy our strong foundation
nature's balance is way off balance
they tip the scale now it's no more silence
the hole in the ozone layer is outta control
but they wanna fight for more oil and gold
unemployment i got laid off
the streets is the last resorts to get paid off
for more more mint no doe for rent
i gotta shed blood to make a red cent
maybe i should ask the president
somebody give me the president
but he don't want to hear it it's out of the question
'cause in my section it's worse than recession
so i go to a rich neighborhood and play robin hood
take from the bad and give to the good
first i go to bensonhurst steal a benz snatch a purse
pick up my friends that's when it gets worse
'cause i need government and they need government
alot of mint spent now i gotta pay rent
who makes the most dead presidents in the projects
you're gonna get robbed and wrecked
i parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot
let's get him for all he got
i approached him slow like i was a base head
put the fofifth to his face and said
you see those kids over there wit the hoods
walk to them real slow and give them the goods
first the gun and the doe and crush the jumbos
one false move and no one knows
'cause i got a silencer to hush the bust
and i'm in a rush so hush the fuss
plus the poison you fed will no longer spread
you good as dead i'm a fill your head wit lead
that's when i pushed him into his building
to murder him but i remember the children
chorus
we gotta teach the children everyday keep a song
show them the light teach them right from wrong
make some sense so they can carry on
teach the children
we gotta teach the children so that they can sing along
understand the words in this song
teach the children save the nation
i see the destruction the situation
they're corrupt and their time's up soon
but they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon
sounds like total recall
but who gotta spaceship you get it we fall
so hope for the best and expect the worst
the end is near and it's uni verse
the one's that interfere wit nature
labeled you limited and underrate ya
his plans over rule when he separates ya
now it's uni verse the one that hates ya
so we gotta let them know we're hip to the script
change the skit or we're about to flip
'cause we want access to happiness
livin' the good life and much success
equal opportunity
self awareness and unity
education the kids need a sculpture
teach them the abacus and their culture
and that'll help stop the robbing raping and killing
poison neighborhoods are illing
but they import more keys from across seas
a drug disease hits the streets wit ease
so keep on building 'cause we gotta keep building
till the answers are filled in
and make sure you don't stop till then
pass the hand grenade
it's gonna blow 'cause i took out the pin
detach the detonator data send
programmed wit protons eqipped wit predicates
electrons and elements just fit
your pronoun hits the ground and that's that
hit the floor like a meteor so get back
commas punctuation  marks separate it sparks
follow the course in to avoid getting sharked
more volts than a lightning bolt handle with care
i'm far from fragile warfare won't tear
i'm armed and  dangerous trained  for combat
let off rounds and they won't just bomb back
explosions i made to invade your parade
 your weak beats' decay 'till they can't get played
wrong elements in the mic they get sprayed
pass the hand grenade
after the stage gets warm i heat it up
the crowd gets charged i speed it up
they couldn't get warm gimme a cut
the rhyme gets good so eat it up
food for thought until your thoughts is sore
fill up a colosseum i can serve them all
bake another plate and cook it far from raw
and if your  overweight then here's some more
'cause every dish i make tastes great and
plus filling if i sold a third of my rhymes i make a killing
get the salt and pepper from the maid
get the blood off the blade pass the hand grenade
if you try this your response is tonsilitis
i'm leaving authors and writers with arthritis
you got the slightest ideas i got the brightest
here's the lightest so clear it's out of sight it's
darkness from the darkness came the light
the night is the time for ra to recite it
educated but complicated style
for all the biters i'm shutting rappers up like midas
i got the force of a turbo porsche
you get lost in the sauce and then thrown off course
you can't destroy the decoys so detour
no sense of direction so what'cha speed for
you wouldn't of never made it how many styles have i created
so many rhymes i bust ya frustrated
then the mic will self sestruct you'll get sprayed
casualties of war
casualties of war as i approach the barricade
where's the enemy  who do i invade
bullets of teflon bulletproof vest rip
tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
cause i got a family that waits for my return
to get back home is my main concern
i'ma get back to new york in one piece
but i'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
sky lights up like fireworks blind me
bullets whistlin over my head remind me
president bush said attack
flashback to nam i might not make it back
missile hits the area screams wake me up
from a war of dreams heat up the m16
basic training trained for torture
take no prisoners and i just caught ya
addicted to murder send more bodybags
they can't identify em leave the nametags
i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor
casualties of war 4x
day divides the night and night divides the day
it's all hard work and no play
more than combat it's far beyond that
cause i got a kill or be killed kind of attack
area's mapped out there'll be no stratego
me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
but what are we here for  who's on the other side of the wall
somebody give the president a call
but i hear warfare scream through the air
back to the battlegrounds it's war they declare
a desert storm let's see who reigns supreme
something like monopoly a government scheme
go to the army be all you can be
another dead soldier  hell no not me
so i start letting off ammunition in every direction
allah is my only protection
but wait a minute saddam hussein prays the same
and this is asia from where i came
i'm on the wrong side so change the target
shooting at the general and where's the sergeant
blame it on john hardy hawkins for bringing me to america
now it's mass hysteria
i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor
casualties of war 4x
the war is over for now at least
just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
it's a long way home it's a lot to think about
whole generation left in doubt
innocent families killed in the midst
it'll be more dead people after this
so i'm glad to be alive and walkin
half of my platoon came home in coffins
except the general buried in the storm
in bits and pieces no need to look for em
i played it slick and got away with it
rigged it up so they would think they did it
now i'm home on reserves and you can bet
when they call i'm going awol
cause it ain't no way i'm going back to war
when i don't know who or what i'm fighting for
so i wait for terrorists to attack
every time a truck backfires i fire back
i look for shelter when a plane is over me
remember pearl harbor  new york could be over g
kamikaze strapped with bombs
no peace in the east they want revenge for saddam
did i hear gunshots or thunder
no time to wonder somebody's going under
put on my fatigues and my camoflouge
take control cause i'm in charge
when i snapped out of it it was blood dead bodies on the floor
double oh seven is back
i don't stress my day cause it's best to parlay
i guess you could say i've been away
i wake up slow when i'm hot but i destruct the plant
and fourteen hands comb new york for fans
they make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed
pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
a mornin massage turnin into a real rough rubdown
so i figured i'll lay around
they keep me wet with a juice called tahiti
it make the room steamy so soon they couldn't see me
they know more than calisthetics as they worked up a sweat
it wasn't even ten o'clock yet
scrub down then i get moist they never treat me mean
they sweetly keep me squeaky clean
i chill as they filled the jacuzzi
it ain't hard cause it's miles from the sidewalk
i'm overlookin every borough in new york
the entire empire state to concentrate
for every rhyme i make
so at exactly noon they played my favorite tune
and just before they all cleared the room
but they wanna go to war they even tried to shoot up the door
double oh seven is back
rest assured
double oh seven is back
feel secure
double oh seven is back
i'm fillin up the page when i'm steppin on stage
got the people in a rage with they hands in the air
fellas sayin hoe everybody yellin go
that's how they react when i attack the mic
in fact it's like a stack of dynamite powerful and bright
girls love to squeeze me real tight
double oh seven is back
ra has returned to romance em better than johnny handsome
ain't nuthin change but the year and i'm still here
c'mere dear and let me whisper in your ear
hug my words so i can taste your lips
i set up hips like domino chips
but i don't let em hit the floor
and if you got sore then feel secure
where's the pain is it the spot you set us in
almost magic better than medicine
take one of these and put your mind at ease
i get more work than a lot of md's
if i'm hawkin new york or out on tour
i express the raw dialect and explore
but don't get fooled by metaphor
double oh seven is back
rest assured
feel secure
rest assured
kill him again
try to identufy the man in front of ya
but it ain't the role the gear or the money the
swift intellectionist with pleny ya
bite if it's dark i'll spark every one of ya
i throw a mic in the crowd it's a question
i got the answer it includes directions
attack your wack 'till it's handicapped
you'll never hold the mic again try to hand it back
cuz every rapper that comes i cut off his thumbs
put a record to his neck if he swallows it hums
slice from ear to earso 'till can hear better
before he bleed to death here hear every letter
and you can see quick and thick the blood can get
if you try to change the style or the subject
as i get deep in the rhyme i'm becomin' a
emcee murdererbefore i'm done i'm a
prepare the chamber the torture's comin' up
trip through the mind at the end you'll find it's
the punisher
kill 'em again
i hold the mic as hostage emcees are ransome
rhymes'll punish 'em cuz they don't undertsand 'em
i heat up his brain then explain then i hand him
a redhot microphonethat's how i planned 'em
rhymes call information unite midnught
like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic
if ya curse me it ain't no mercy
give him a autopsy killed by a verse of me
i took a kid and cut off his eyelid
kill him slow so he could see what i did
and if he don't understand what i said
i'm pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head
so he can see what he's getting into
a part of the mind that he never been through
a journey is coming cuz ya getting sent to 
a place harder to find but it's all in the mental
i ran a brainscan to locate his game plan
when i'm through with his brain he ain't the same man
did he lose his mind or lost in his mind
but this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find
your foundation coasting your mind is
drifting in slow motionfrozen
looks like another murder at the mardi gras b
too late to send out a search party
once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back
i give 'em a map but he still get trapped so
prepare the chamber the torture's coming up
trip through the mind at the end you'll find it's the punisher
kill 'em again
dangerous rhymes are performed like surgery
cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy
my intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex
your cerebellum is next 
your conscience becomes subconscious
soon your response is nonsense
the last words are blurredmumbled then slurred
then your verbs are no longer heard
you get your lung fried so good you're tonguetied
he couldn't swing or hang so he hung 'till he died
reincarnate him and kill him againagain and againagain and again
i leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him
i got a dead mc ing museum
when i create 'em i cremate 'em and complicate 'em
you can't save 'emthere's no ultamatum
mic's lay around full of ashes with the victim's name in slashes
got a long list and i'm a get every one of ya
beware of the punisher
then i'm a kill 'em again
wake 'em up kill 'em again
relax with pep
my styles will move
i'm calm but deadly heat up but cool
i'm rough as a right hook but still look smooth
even when i'm unseen i show and prove
women i give 'em pain and still soothe
as i 'll put you down when them hard to put up wit
swell up like helium but i can make you fit
i'm taking what i want and make you wanna give it here
provoking you to flaunt you get the idea
got it gone my schedule is packed
my day is lay back 'cause i'm ahead of all that
then i can relax 'cause i'm before my time
i hand you a manual before the rhymes
so you can catch up and keep up and move right alone
the day is kind of off but i can get it on
i'm taking it step by step and when the night is in depth
it's cool 'cause i'm relax wit pep
relax wit pep
i inchant a riot wit a quiet storm
is it the way i parlay or the knowledge being born
all praise due to the magnificient most high and magnificient
from him i was sent wit intent to invent
new ways for better displays for better days
no more crimes i got rhymes and it pays
i'm prepared to take mine and get mine
and i can protect mine even wit a rhyme or a nine
a silent rage but i'm amplified
rhymes multiply it's hard to provoke when i
put a mode in effect the episode's correct
reload and you don't know code to respect
i get swift and change a rule adapt the master
but still remainable rap gets faster
reacts and projects and tracks and it get
to the max it's in depth it attacks but it's relax wit pep
relax wit pep
relax wit pep relax wit pep
check one them i'm a check another one two
the r's brand new so you can view a view
i got equisite exhibit explizzit
is it a whiz kid or kid quiz it well is it
relax i'll track out lap the halpf stepper
here come the right one baby and dr pepper
so check the wreck up scale rhymes overload
blow up and explode abrupt and reload the code
you can't pinpoint a low cape the rape
or evaluate the up to date skate
up front laid back coming off on track
girls want some of this  because i'm all of that
sweat the concept as the epps in depth
as the track is kept you can't intercept the step
react and projects and it tracks and it gets
to the max and in depth it attacks but it's relax wit pep
relax wit pep
relax wit pep it's relax wit pep
she asked could i keep the beat
so here's the beat everytime it pounds you get weak
comfy imbedded like a pillow bouncin wit an echo
my voice is moist and  plus mellow
i got it going on you're gonna wanna come
skins is the drum i said i'm the drummer give the drummer some
and we'll see if you can hang wit ra
hm let's see if you can shangrila
easy like tina marie i play it slick
like rick james i'm the fire in your desire's flames
i heat up your temperature keep the tempo raw
when you start to smoke rest assured
i start to think 'cause you're a singer like anita
high pitched like a tweeter deep beats start to beat her
much harder than love taps my rap's above that
i get girls where i want wit a maze full of lovetraps
but i don't want to fall in love
i stand in love good balanced wit a plan to shove
accapella as we start to speak
heart to heart and cheek to cheek then i complete the beat
chorus
tempo's moving and i'm hoping it'll never fade away
the beat is grooving words are soothing and please tell me that you're here 
to stay
in the morning and i'm hoping the morning come again
hold me close and give me another dose and
keep the beat don't ever let it end
she said ah so far you didn't miss a beat yet
pop in another cassette then i'm in to wreck
i'll give you a beat you never had before
i had to explore and came up wit more
deep trunk kicks wit a brick for a drum stick
you know the song don't hum along come quick
you lay like sade it feels like paradise
at the top of the pyramid we review new heights
the scenery of egypt you and me as we get 
so deep in the groove when you move you get seasick
you seen enough close your eyes and relax
move wit the tracks and stay tuned for the sax
the instrumental enters your mental
tense but gentle and sentimental
accapella as we start to speak
heart to heart and cheek to cheek then i complete the beat
chorus
she wanted the extended version
so i kept splurging and add more words in
strong the emotion notions move and
the poetry's smoking potions soothing
there goes the moon i'm far from done
rise like the sun here comes the sun
and i won't stop 'till  it sets and then
rewind the cassettes and i'm a play it again
but this time it's instrumental at a faster tempo
i work overtime on your body and mind
'cause i'm incline to do both combined
my job is never done but done well
horizontal or parallel
accapella as we start to speak
heart to heart and cheek to cheek then i complete the beat
chorus
what's going on
what's happening it's been so long what's going on
and what's going wrong the good old days are gone
you forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
you invented a scam even you don't understand
you rig the enigma can't figure it out
you change the route now you're in doubt
you use to cut class smoked grass still passed
figured you was all that but that ain't last
the times is harder the drugs is heavier
you say whatever the more the merrier
smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes
now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes
no more good times no more time
too far to find you're almost blind
you can't see what spot that the trap is in
hey brawhat's happening
you had it mapped out your plans get torn
you stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
you said you quit stated your word is bond
hey bro what's going on
what's going on
my neighborhood don't look so good
i'll find a way out yeah i would if i could
but the government is doing a project
 so i live in the projects
where we fight for elbow room to the doom
try to live long but you die too soon
i might not be alive to see 25
taught at ten to make money and strive
i sold tapes at school and made some ends
met alot of skins and even made some friends
cool 'cause now i got a crew to run wit
break a couple of rules have crazy fun wit
but every now and then they give my knuckle game a test
but i won't fess i just get rid of the stress
and then shake hands like a man
'cause it's a family thing only the crew would understand
but you had a one on one fight wit drugs
when we ain't cool no more we buss slugs
clip after clip until one of us is gone
hey bra what's going on
yo what's going on
the crime rate in new york state elevate
a city filled wit hate more deaths accumulate
drug wars daily alot of blood spilt
kids on the playground shot down and kilt
nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more
'cause stray bullets explore
we're killing ourselves off slowly but surely
and at the end of the year i'm sure many more'll be
rubbed out in a quest for clout
the rest'll be drugged out this is bugged out
half of the projects is dead or locked up
kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up
human abortion create distortions
and that's just a portion you know that we're lost when
babies are  addicted to drugs when they are born
hey bra what's going on
hey bra what's going on
hey bra what's going on
sip the juice cuz i got enough to go around
and the thought takes place uptown
i grew up on the sidewalk where i learned street talk
and then taught to hawk new york
i go to queens for queens to get the crew from brooklyn
make money in manhattan and never been tooken
go uptown and the bronx to boogie down
get strong on the island recoupe and lay around
time to bulid my juice back up
props back up suckers get smacked up
don't doubt the clout you know what i'm about
knocking niggaz off knocking niggaz out
shaking em up waking em up
raking em up breaking em up
standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge
let's see if i know the ledge
corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here
i get cockd liffin' forty's of beer
here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
if i get revenge then they rest in peace
somebody's got to suffer i just might spare one
and give a brother a fair one
and i do work with these like hercules
switch to southpaw split your right jaw
'cause i don't like y'all i'm hype when night fall
smooth but i move like an army
bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
putting brothers to rest like elliot ness
'cause i don't like stress
streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand
nutting's gonna stop the plan
i'll chill like pacino kill like deniro
black gambino die like a hero
living on shaky grounds too close to the edge
let's see if i know the ledge
shells lay around on the battleground
dead bodies are found throughout the town
tried to put shame in my game to make a name i'm a
put it on a bullet put it in your brain
rip the block like a buckshot
who cares where it goes just keep the casket closed
no remorse when a life is lost
i paid my dues paid the cost
and my pockets are still fat
wherever i'm at i get the welcome mat
even if my crew steep with one deep
i attract attention people like to peep
so come say hi to the bad guy
don't say goodbye i don't plan to die
'cause i get loose and i got troops
and crazy juice
in control of many like ayatollah khomeini
hang out wit smith and wesson don't try to play me
i'm at war a lot like anwar sadat
but no warning shot my gun is warm a lot
when i cook beef the smoke will never clear
areas interfere but this here's severe
living life too close to the edge
hoping that i know the ledge
a brand new morn no time to yawn
shower's on power's on
late for school i catch the train
girls sip cristal and whisper my name
i push up like an exercise
check the intellect and inspect the thighs
select the best one pull her to the side 
keep her occupied for the rest of the ride          
read my resume she's know i'm 'ready cool                  
just meet me after school
we can moan and groan until your mom come home
sweatin' me she didn't want to let me loose
come get me that's if you want to sip the juice
cause the streets await me so i take my gun off safety
cause alot of niggaz hate me
coming out of the building they set me up
sprayed wit automatics they wet me up
in a puddle of blood i lay close to the edge
don't sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique
let's trace the hints and check the file
let see who bit to detect the style
i flip the script so they can't get foul
at least not now it'll take a while
i change the pace to complete the beat
i drop the bass'till mc's get weak
for every word they trace it's a scar they keep
'cause when i speak they freak
to sweat the technique
i made my debut in '86
wit a melody and a president's mix
and now i stay on target and refuse to miss
and i still make hits
wit' beats parties clubs in the cars and jeeps
my underground sound vibrates the streets
mc's wanna beef then i play for keeps
when they sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique
they wanna know how many rhymes have i ripped in rep but
researchers never found all the pieces yet
scientists try to solve the context
philosophers are wondering what's next
pieces are took to last who observe them
they couldn't absorb them they didn't deserve them
my ideas are only for the audience's ears
for my opponents it might take years
pencils and pens are swords
letters put together form a key to chords
i'm also a sculpture born with structure
because of my culture i'm a rip and destruct the
difficult styles that'll be for the technology
complete sights and new heights after i get deep
you don't have to speak just seek
and peep the technique
but don't sweat the technique
i speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
then i get deep and the weak then complete their
pull with a seat never weak or obsolete
they never grow old techniques become antiques
better then something  brand new 'cause it's radiant
and the wild style'll have much more volume
classical too intelligent to be radical
masterful never  irrelevant mathematical
here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
they fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
it's cool when you freak to the beat
but don't sweat the technique
kick along
kick along
kick along
if you like it accapella  soul clap will be sweet
almost complete
feel the impact when it hit the street
but uh it sound thicker when i kick it wit a beat
see i can let it speak for itself
but every now and then i need a little help
guess who to the rescue  comp
ripping up comp i step and then stomp
a spark scam'll skin the land like it's a timberland
prepare the stage for rakim to stand
then i pick a song grab the mic click it on
time to get it on kick along
see if you can move to the words i speak
pick up on a rhythm kickin' wit da beat
my mentallect gets warm feed into your physical form
you can't keep calm
get fit to the skit try to hop on
get up to the trick as i flip the script
you're feeling rust like a thrust of an arrow plus
you're looking through the eye of a barrel bus
emergency take him to the operating room
put him on the floor let his heart feel the boom
react to the wrath of a brand new song
then kick along
kick along 5x
a kick is a hip wit hop
a pep wit step like the floor is hot
i project alot so you can use every kick you got
but don't forget don't kick when i stop
i'm something like simon says
as i'm pumping hype rhymes in your heads
the mic's a remote control and i'm pointing it at cha
when i push buttons you're gonna have ta
break straight to the floor
'cause i'm a make more
each one's composed in the shows
and each one flows how long nobody knows
and whoever try to take 'em i'm a break 'em
drag it out of him dehydrate 'em
the beat makes the beat in your heart accelerate
your pulse is a drumroll it's too late to wait
a pen'll send adrendaline to ten
if then begin to blend the smooth that's sent
that's to prevent you from getting asthma
you try to keep up because the cut has ya
blood pressure to the point never stops a drop
putting stain in the veins in the brain ya blood clots
too quick to pause it you almost lost it
so kick along to you're all exhausted
and look what my data made my power'll  never fade
i keep it energetic or hype as gatorade
now kick it wit a beat
c'mon kick along
kick along
kick along
kick along
they can't wait to kick steps to this
so i make a skit just for kicks
syncopated pausing though
innovated 'cause the flow
melodic and melodramatic styles occur
like a choreographer my mind's a photographer
making music visible for the individual
that gets visual
what i manifest you express on the dance floor
pants get torn when the jam is on
'cause i kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back
it's hard to kick that where did 'cha get that
here's the concept part of you're concert
expect the expert to perfect and do work
don't stop the song 'til i'm gone
keep getting it on kick it off with the horns
kick along
kick along
kick along
kick along
what are you giving them back
umm i think what i'm givin them back man is umm
what they been waitin for yaknahmean  umm
what uhh yo
just when things seemed the same and the whole scene is lame
i come and reign with the unexplained for the brains 'til things change
they strain to sling slang i'm trained to bring game
history that i arranged been regained by king james
go to practice with tactics when the track hits theatrics
women that look like actress the status of cleopatra's
stacks of mathematics to feed yoasiatics
as i find out what the facts is for geographic
no time to sip mo's with hostess never mind what the total gross is
i rip shows stay focused and split cheese with soldiers
while you hit trees and coast i spit flows that be ferocious
and with these explosives i split seas for moses
shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
determinely advance technology better than germany
since the first days you know of till the last days is over
i was always the flower i made waves for noah
from a compound to the anatomy to the breakdown of a atom
some of my rap patterns still surround saturn
from the ancient hieroglyphics to graffiti painted pictures
i study i know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
date back i go beyond check the holy qu'ran
to speeches at the autobahn now we get our party on
so being benificent i bless em with dialogue
they expectin the next testament by the god
i roam through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
blast beat with saxophones one of the baddest rappers known
every country city and borough sidestreet and ghetto
isle and alley and meadow theories thorough enough to echo
when it was one mass of land with one nash' of man
and the whole mass was ran under one master plan
since the world's metamorphis and the plan is kept in orbit
turntables we spin awkward but needles never skip off it
rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
it'll answer your questions if you understand the message
from the days of the slave choppers to the new age of prophets
as heavy as hiphop is i'm always ready to drop it
from the mind which is one of allah's best designs
and mines'll stand the test of time when i rhyme
        the 18th letter the prophecy professor
        i stay clever long as the planet stay together
        bring up praise from mecca make a phrase for the better
        in new days to remember always and forever
it feel good ya knahmean
to uhh come back and and get embraced
that's that's like the best part y'know
bein bein gone for a while y'know
walk through the streets
'yo ra yo when you comin out you gotta come out'
this and that
y'know so y'know i always want to come back
had little setbacks but umm
to comeback and get embraced man that's the best part
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records

nobody been this long awaited since jesus
who wouldn't believe this  i heard the word on the street is
i'm still one of the deepest on the mic since adidas
they said i changed the times from the rhymes that i thought of
so i made some more to put the new world in order
with mathematics put your status above the average
and help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics
cause new days is dawnin new ways of peformin
brainstormin i write and watch the night turn to mornin
on and on and i got the whole world respondin
rock i keep it hot and blow the spot without warnin
the emperor well known for inventin a sentence
full of adventure turnin up the temperature
rush with adrenaline how long has it been again
to be in the state of mind that rakim is in
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
when i'm out proppin  either hangin or shoppin
people see me stop and ask me when the album droppin
the wait is over information like a soldier
like i told ya greater stronger now that i'm older
i broke the code of silence with overloads of talents
my only challenge is not to explode in violence
i'm asiatic and blazin microphones a habit
at least once durin the course of a day it's automatic
in ghetto apparel mind of a egyptian pharoah
far from shallow thoughts travel like an arrow
allah's monotony so far they can't stop me
you know ra want property like mumar khadafi
more thoughts than bibles recital  taught disciples
a sawed off mic so words scatter like a rifle
thoughts that's trifle i'm bustin these for you 
aiyyo technical difficulties is through
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
when i float at night i show em new heights i go to write
they know i strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
critics and biters don't know where my source of light is
still leave authors and writers with arthritis
cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style
first to ever let a rhyme flow down the nile
the rebirth of hiphop'll be dropped now
cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
so be alarmed what you bout to see is the bomb
like 3d in nam vivid like cd rom
my notebook's my bond like the holy qu'ran
since i came in the door said it before
but no i ain't down with eric b no more
at night the open mic be invitin me to rhyme
so yo i'm online it's been a long time
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
remember that
turn the beat up i get lost in the mind come across
the rhyme kick my feet up then i find myself in time
i was on a train destination marley marl's domain
i entertained things'll never be the same
dj's are conveyed if the label ok it
teddy ted and special k was the first ones to play it
on the radio with the crazy flow
i pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show
when i'm at the helm i cover the whole realm
in control and leave your soul overwhelmed
another influence of beats and instruments
lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense
when you was playin pac man it was the jams i packed
peeps would swarm when i was perform in black i'm all that
back before they turned hiphop to rap
it always a place to party at remember that
i remember the spots that used to be hot
just like the roof top a place that only few can rock
on a wild ass block yeah you find me there a lot
until you hear gunshots that's when the fun stops
here come the cops time to go home get in order
cause i'll be back in manhattan if somethings happenin at the latin quarter
house of havoc when it came to fourteen carat
and if you had it yeah kids'd try to grab it
it's cool at the red parrot we was doin it there
i was the first one to rip it at the union square
me and dj red alert did work
a crazy concert a lot of kids got hurt
i did encores at the encore they wanted more
i kicked a freestyle til i heard the crowd roar
like the funhouse bronx center never endin black
place to be was the brooklyn armory remember that
remember that 3x
open the door let the crowds in over twenty thousand
wildin music's loud and microphone's growlin
tickets are sold out parties is packed and on tour
rippin basketball arenas back then
even afterparties posses of players and hotties
everybody was gotti spreadin bucks like shotties
spendin cash to make a good time last
thoughts that i had give me a blast of the past
memories of unforgettable times on my mind
dollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes
the people i met and the sets that got wrecked
all the mics i checked most of all life's effects
and peace to all the people i grew up around
in the streets back when beats had a rougher sound
i used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile
keep piles of pictures filed in case i go senile
cause some things are just too good to be forgot
like your neighborhood block or your favorite spot
certain records always seem to make me reminisce
and when it hits and then it clicks remember this
my life flashed before me i'm there from the sounds
i hear pinpoint the year it's perfectly clear
i like the way it went down and alla that in fact
it mean a lot cause you can't bring it back remember that
 ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh
here we go
repeat 5x
yo the saga begins my eyes is the photography lens
properly push pens and show quality gems
the horrors be grim but yo maybe tomorrow we win
if we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend
i want a mahogany benz i want lottery ends
i want property friends plus my hobby is skins
if i decide we in sin then my prophesy ends
but the god'll begin watchin my odyssey spin
in the place where war be based on a true story
territory was made for me to pursue glory
blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn
every capacity blown i'm internationally known yo
        
so all hail the honorable microphone phenomenal
persona is invulnerable trust me son
i continue like a saga do bringin you the drama to
allow you that the chronicle has just begun
        
yo my neverending epic got the world spinning hectic
i quickly spread it till the whole city's infected
suspense that i supply intensify
then commence as my daily events go by
you get involved in this paragraphologist
narratin novelist market this sound marvelous
i'm the star in this which means the author's authentic
most definite every episode's a epidemic
so when you research check it here go the evidence
they represent with lyrical negligence for presidents
my science existed without the fiction
every inscription is a special edition
        
yo the legacy lives let em see what the pedigree is
megathesis blessin these kids with extra features
the depth's deep as the deepest sea is
telepathy increases melody gets speakers telekinesis
ideas appear as clear as pictures in movie theaters
lyrics you hear it devestating the way you ear it
so stay tuned for sequels part two's and more
so soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store
the names have changed the game remain the same
how one came to reign on his claim to fame
no stoppin this i'm droppin this with hiphop in this
and when the topic is topicless then i'm writing the apocalypse
        
 track 7
kind of glad i ain't come out in this y'know the last few years y'know
but umm right now i think everybody want a change
back to hiphop and knowhati'msayin rhymes skills and
things of that nature so timing man timing is perfect
plus this is ninetyseven which is born god knahmean
and i'm back straight up
yeah yeah
it's the return of the wild style fashionist
smashin hits make it hard to adapt to this
put pizazz and jazz in this and cash in this
mastered this flash this and make em clap to this
dj's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
just pump the volume up and play it loud
hiphop's embedded before i said i wouldn't let it
but me and the microphone is still magnetic
straight off the top i knew i'd be forced to rock
dancefloors just stop the spot's scorchin hot
hoping i open rakim allah seminars
massage at the bar smokin ten dollar cigars
while i admire midas with more vision than tv's
i find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties
sit back and wait to hear a slammin track
rockin jams by popular demand i'm back

i control the crowd you know i hold it down
when it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
from town to town until it's world reknowned
and i rock new york city all year around
check it out
it's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
thought patterns displayed on persian rugs
equations are drawn up in paisley form
mic it stay warm my flow is evian
deep as a nautilus you stay dipped in ra style
from the shores of long island to panama canal
intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
i'm in effect quicker than medicines in china
split the mic open fill it with somethin potent to go in
and take a toke then mental planes start floatin
hot science is smokin altitudes cause chokin
product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin
showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
plans to scheme means i'll forever fiend
long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
i'ma move crowds to 2000

yo my rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
since fat crayons i write and display chaos
my plan is damage the diagram to where the jam
i take advantage until the crowd go bananas
what a rush i hear cuts then i lust to touch
microphones get clutched by the illustrious
word spread i inherited many ways to say the unsaid
born with three 7's in my head
in time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
to find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
astrologists professors from your smartest colleges
with knowledge of scholarships when ra be droppin this
some of the things i know will be in your next bible
when i die go bury me and my notebook in cairo
with the great god from egypt manifest was write rhymes
align with the stars i come back to bless the mic
word up rakim allah the microphone fiend is back yaknahmean
till death do us part
it's on
ra sample in sequence to 350
 the incredible the incredible
 the incredible
 once again back is the incredible
rakim clark kent bring it on
what you wanna say to make me stay awhile
what you wanna say to make me wanna stay
just me and my peeps we gettin buzzed lookin for clubs
misses with kisses and hugs lookin for love
she gotta be nice with hers even with cookin some grub
once i'm in i meet her friends then i'm hookin my thugs
we'll be blowin hundreds always knowin where the fun is
roadrunners findin more spots than columbus
pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders
i take my time and find where the right one is
smooth as jazz but more than a half ready for math
and on a steady path like betty shabazz
and when i see the wiz i'ma step to my biz
and there she is let's see if she pass the quiz
it's appropriate we go get soakin wet
toast we met become close associates
the place is ours by now i can embrace your style
so much flavor i can taste your smile stay awhile
why don't you stay a little while

i want the format to the doormat
contacts fast callbacks and all that
your deepest ecstasy see you wear accesory
your secret recipes to your bear necessities
she real exotic body feel like lucile roberts
name brand closets culturized products
claws like a scorpion caught me in deeper
but juice sweeter enough to buy a two seater
every mile i plan to have your mind beguiled
til it informs me more than you would normally allow
raised more than an eyebrow with a flagrant style
by now i can taste your smile stay awhile
chorus
sometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited
but she know i like it she know the deal like a psychic
mind is haunted because i always find her on it
she know what i want where i want when i want it
blowin up my motorola daddy you comin over
she on the sofa holdin a remote controller
candles burnin lower favorite dish gettin colder
she hot as solar cause i told her i wanna hold her
but her mission she sittin in one position like yoda
a tv show is on to top it off she dead sober
then i open the door up and kiss her on the shoulder
she say i'm rollin like mr lover lover
we had a hard day ready to parlay
my thirsts they obey everything that god say
okay let's play awhile and i'll embrace your style
so much flavor i can taste your smile stay awhile

you know that
aiyyo once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets you see stress
streets a matter of life and death no regrets
life's a test strife wit special effects
neighbourhood's full of reps cities are projects
where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
and comrades quest to be the next to finess 
collect debts and select bets with death threats
object  chedder better your total net
where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
avenues to check boulevards to sweat
the smell of gunsmoke more common than cigarettes
we got clicks for wreck
we like pits for pets
we got giants and jets the knicks yanks and mets
we like much respect and sex extra wet
and hightech dialect you ain't catch yet
the bronx

big shots with big knots and big props

where herbs get got if you snitch you get shot
we get down and leave the town in a state of shock
we got dangerous hang out spots and slick cops
place called riker's island where kids get locked
a lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
styles are top notch this is the place to watch
so bust the box the radio station is hot
ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops
flip scripts for chips and new whips off the lot
quick to call a shot pollitic with thick plots
and the garden of eden against the sea that we got
to make sure the core of the big apple don't rot
where seeings believing we be achieving a lot
since disc jocks created hip hop check it out
queens  ya out there no doubt
manhattan  no doubt
new york city staten island
new york new york long island

a mass of peeps with they own masterpiece
the crafts elite we going past the beat

so just knowin that people umm compare me with with every hot kid that
come out and y'know the the expressions people give me when i see em
in the streets sometime y'know people be lookin at me like i'm a martian
me lovin this man lovin this
introchorus
if you can see if you can solve the mystery
the answer revolves around your history
so carefully i drop this degree
scientifically and realistically who is god
repeat chorus
in eternal blackness in the midst of the darkest night
proteins and minerals exist within specks of light
solids liquids and gases and sparks of light within
infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights
no beginning or ending the seven dimensions
enough space for more than a million words and inventions
to travel through time within enough room to be the womb
of the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine
with intelligent elements in sight that he will gather
in the realms of relativity electricity struck matter
energies explode he below to keep releasin
atoms by the millions til the numbers increasin
til it was burnin he kept returnin itself to the source
the hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force
he gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws
all caused by his mental intercourse who is god
chorus
he began to explain his craft the master in the attic
he dealt with measurements his language was mathematics
his theoretical wisdom of the numerical system
the complete number nine which means born or existed
he gave birth to all planets inorganic and organic
so you wouldn't take it for granted
they rotated they own distance around the sun
and fully submit to the existance of one
and each one was promised everlasting perfection
if each one keeps spinnin in the same direction
to the east and each speak the motion of peace
and harmony and each show devotion to teach
the universe is to come the whole world must go according
know your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin
so stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound
like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round
chorus
from unconciousness to conciousness
by knowledging his wisdom his response is this
a understanding which is the best part
he picked the third planet where new forms of life would start
he pursued show and prove every move in order
back to the source he let off his resources in the water
climb his climax where the climate is at high degrees
see he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas
and the plan is to lay in the clays to form land
and expand usin the same clays to born man
in his own image our origin begins in the east
culture rise to breed with the powers of peace
deal in equality nature's policy is to be god
build or destroy positively born life like allah
and each one was given everlasting perfection
if each one keep living in the same direction
and life was life and love was love
we went according by the laws of the world above
they showed us physically we could reach infinity
but mentally through the century we lost our identity
life start and ending we got trife and started sinning
lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin
and what was once easy became confused and hard
which brings us back to the mystic question who is god
sixtysix trillion years since his face was shown
when the seventh angel appears the mystery will be known
check revelations and genesis st luke and john
it even tells us we are gods in the holy qu'ran
wisdom strength and beauty one of the meanings of god
god you and me gomars o dubar
knowledge wisdom understanding sun moon and star
man woman and child and so is allah
chorus
bear witness to allah gave birth to all
for allah was all and therefore life itself
and the universe gave birth to man
the universe was man and man was the universe
and the universe was always existed
and existance was life
and life is allah
and allah had no beginning because he is what always was
rakim allah peace
yes yes y'all check it out y'all repeat
yes yes y'all check it out y'all repeat

and make you focus on the future after seein the beginning
and my style wilds like miles on the trumpet
volume dial was kind of low need to pump it
up another notch turn the dial til it stops
more watts you got more things to watch

dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
follow procedures the crowd couldn't wait to see this
nobody been this long awaited since jesus
who wouldn't believe this  i heard the word on the street is
i'm still one of the deepest on the mic since adidas
they said i changed the times from the rhymes that i thought of
so i made some more to put the new world in order
with mathematics put your status above the average
and help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics
cause new days is dawnin new ways of peformin
brainstormin i write and watch the night turn to mornin
on and on and i got the whole world respondin
rock i keep it hot and blow the spot without warnin
the emperor well known for inventin a sentence
full of adventure turnin up the temperature
rush with adrenaline how long has it been again
to be in the state of mind that rakim is in
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
when i'm out proppin  either hangin or shoppin
people see me stop and ask me when the album droppin
the wait is over information like a soldier
like i told ya greater stronger now that i'm older
i broke the code of silence with overloads of talents
my only challenge is not to explode in violence
i'm asiatic and blazin microphones a habit
at least once durin the course of a day it's automatic
in ghetto apparel mind of a egyptian pharoah
far from shallow thoughts travel like an arrow
allah's monotony so far they can't stop me
you know ra want property like mumar khadafi
more thoughts than bibles recital  taught disciples
a sawed off mic so words scatter like a rifle
thoughts that's trifle i'm bustin these for you 
aiyyo technical difficulties is through
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
when i float at night i show em new heights i go to write
they know i strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
critics and biters don't know where my source of light is
still leave authors and writers with arthritis
cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style
first to ever let a rhyme flow down the nile
the rebirth of hiphop'll be dropped now
cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
so be alarmed what you bout to see is the bomb
like 3d in 'nam vivid like cdrom
my notebook's my bond like the holy qu'ran
since i came in the door said it before
but no i ain't down with eric b no more
at night the open mic be invitin me to rhyme
so yo i'm online it's been a long time
dj premier cuts early eric b  rakim records
yeah yeah
it's the return of the wild style fashionist
smashin hits make it hard to adapt to this
put pizazz and jazz in this and cash in this
mastered this flash this and make em clap to this
dj's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
just pump the volume up and play it loud
hiphop's embedded before i said i wouldn't let it
but me and the microphone is still magnetic
straight off the top i knew i'd be forced to rock
dancefloors just stop the spot's scorchin hot
hoping i open rakim allah seminars
massage at the bar smokin ten dollar cigars
while i admire midas with more vision than tv's
i find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties
sit back and wait to hear a slammin track
rockin jams by popular demand i'm back

i control the crowd you know i hold it down
when it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
from town to town until it's world reknowned
and i rock new york city all year around
check it out
it's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
thought patterns displayed on persian rugs
equations are drawn up in paisley form
mic it stay warm my flow is evian
deep as a nautilus you stay dipped in ra style
from the shores of long island to panama canal
intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
i'm in effect quicker than medicines in china
split the mic open fill it with somethin potent to go in
and take a toke then mental planes start floatin
hot science is smokin altitudes cause chokin
product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin
showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
plans to scheme means i'll forever fiend
long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
i'ma move crowds to 2000

yo my rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
since fat crayons i write and display chaos
my plan is damage the diagram to where the jam
i take advantage until the crowd go bananas
what a rush i hear cuts then i lust to touch
microphones get clutched by the illustrious
word spread i inherited many ways to say the unsaid
born with three 7's in my head
in time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
to find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
astrologists professors from your smartest colleges
with knowledge of scholarships when ra be droppin this
some of the things i know will be in your next bible
when i die go bury me and my notebook in cairo
with the great god from egypt manifest was write rhymes
align with the stars i come back to bless the mic
 2x
word up rakim allah the microphone fiend is back yaknahmean
till death do us part
it's on
ra sample in sequence to 350
 the incredible the incredible
 the incredible
 once again back is the incredible
what is the one main thing that you have
that you would want people to remember you by
or not one but the those things that are dear to you
that you would want to be remembered as
i guess i guess it's my words man yaknahmean
just my words and if people remember my words they'll remember me forever
y'know  god by nature mind raised in asia y'know
but umm it's like y'know to live forever you you you gotta
set y'know not not set trends but you gotta
apply yourself a certain way and you gotta do certain things y'know
maybe maybe when i'm gone twenty years from now
somebody might be tellin tellin they little son
youknowhati'msayin  if that can happen man i'm aight man y'know
i got i got i got kids y'know  they gonna umm finish this for
me anyway you know i'm saying so regardless y'know the legacy lives
but umm as far as the masses just remember my words
it's been a long time i shouldn't have left you
without a strong rhyme to step to
think of how many weak shows you slept through
time's up i'm sorry i kept you
thinking of this you keep repeating you miss
the rhymes from the microphone soloist
and you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon
as you hear it pump up the volume
dance wit the speaker 'till  you hear it blow
then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
it's a 4 letter word when it's heard  it control
your body to dance you got it soul
ditects the tempo like a red alert
reaches your reflex so let it work
when this is playing you can't get stuck wit
the steps so get set and i'm a still come up wit
a gift to be swift follow the leader the rhyme will go
def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
it can be done but only i can do it
for those that can dance and clap your hands to it
i start to think and then i sink
into the paper like i was ink
when i'm writing i'm trapped in between the lines
i escape when i finish the rhyme
i got soul
you got it 4x
i know you got soul
picture a mic the stage is empty
a beat like this might tempt me
to pose show my rings and my fat gold chain
grab the mic like i'm on soul train
but i'll wait 'cause i mastered this
let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
eric b break the sticks you got it
rakim will begin when you make the mix
i'll experiment like a scientist
you wanna rhyme you gotta sign my list
'cause i'm a manifest and bless the mic i hold
you want it next  then you gotta have soul
'cause if you ain't got it i'm a make an encore
take the mic make the people respond for
the r 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
if you wanna get on after me
think about it wait erase your rhyme
forget it and don't waste your time
'cause i'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
drop the mic you shouldn't be holding it
this is how it should be done
this style is identical to none
some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
so upset that i'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
i drip steam like a microphone fiend
eager to mc is my theme
i get hype when i hear a drum roll
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul
you got it 5x
i got soul you got it that's why i came
to teach those who can't say my name
first of all i'm the soloist the soul controller
rakim gets stronger as i get older
constant elevation causes expansion
i write my rhyme while i cool in my mansion
then put it on tape and in the city i test it
then on the radio the r's requested
you listen to it the concept might break you
'cause almost anyone can relate to
whoever's out of hand i'm give him handles
light 'em up blow 'em out like candles
or should i just let him melt
then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
i'm not bold just cuz i rock gold
rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul
you got it 4x
now i'm a stop to see what you got
get off the mic before i get too hot
i want to see which posse can dance the best
it should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
now if your from uptown brooklyn bound
the bronx queens or long island sound
even other states come right and exact
it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
since you came here you have to show and prove
and do that dance until it don't move
'cause all you need is soul selfesteem will release
the rest is up to you rakim 'll say peace
you got it 10x
verse one 
 
follow me into a solo 
get in the flow  and you can picture like a photo 
music mixed mellow maintains to make
melodies for mc's motivates the breaks 
i'm everlastin i can go on for days and days 
with rhyme displays that engrave deep as xrays 
i can take a phrase that's rarely heard flip it 
now it's a daily word 
i can get iller than 'nam a killin bomb
but no alarm  rakim will remain calm 
selfesteem make me super superb and supreme 
but for a microphone still i fiend 
this was a tape i wasn't supposed to break 
i was supposed to wait but let's motivate 
i want to see who can keep followin and swallowin 
takin the making bitin it and borrowin 
brothers tried and others died to get the formula 
but i'ma let ya sweat  you still ain't warm
you a step away from frozen stiff as if ya posin 
dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen 
so follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first
let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe 
what could ya say as the earth gets further and further away 
planets are small as balls of clay 
astray into the milky way  world's outasight 
far as the eye can see  not even a satellite 
now stop and turn around and look 
as ya stare in the darkness ya knowledge is took 
so keep starin soon ya suddenly see a star 
you better follow it cause it's the r 
this is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
hurry hurry step right up and keep followin 
the leader 
 
verse two 
 
this is a lifetime mission vision of prison 
aight listen 
in this journey you're the journal i'm the journalist 
am i eternal or an eternalist 
i'm about to flow long as i can possibly go 
keep ya movin cause the crowd said so 
dance  cuts rip ya pants 
eric b on the blades bleedin to death  call the ambulance
pull out my weapon and start to squeeze 
a magnum as a microphone murderin' mc's 
let's quote a rhyme from a record i wrote 
follow the leader yeah  dope 
cause everytime i stop it seems ya stuck 
soon as ya try to step off ya selfdestruct 
i came to overcome before i'm gone 
by showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born 
then after that i'll live forever  you disagree 
you say never then follow me 
from century to century you'll remember me 
in history  not a mystery or a memory 
god by nature mind raised in asia 
since you was tricked i have to raise ya 
from the cradle to the grave but remember 
you're not a slave 
cause we was put here to be much more than that 
but we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped 
but i'm here to break away the chains take away the pains 
remake the brains reveal my name 
i guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous 
it can't be mixed diluted it can't be changed or switched 
here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing 
hurry hurry step right up and keep following 
the leader 
 
verse three 
 
a furified freestyle lyrics of fury 
my third eye makes me shine like jewelry 
you're just a rentarapper your rhymes are minutemaid 
i'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade 
i can't wait to break and eliminate 
on every traitor or snake  so stay awake 
and follow and follow because the tempo's a trail 
the stage is a cage the mic is a third rail 
i'm rakim the fiend of a microphone 
i'm not him so leave my mic alone 
soon as the beat is felt i'm ready to go 
so fasten your seatbelt cause i'm about to flow 
no need to speed slow down to let the leader lead 
word to daddy indeed 
the r's a rollin stone so i'm rollin 
directions is told then the rhymes are stolen 
stop buggin' a brother said dig em i never dug 'em 
he couldn't follow the leader long enough so i drug 'em 
into danger zone he should arrange his own
face it it's basic erase it change ya tone
there's one r in the alphabet 
it's a oneletter word and it's about to get 
more complex from one rhyme to the next 
eric b be easy on the flex 
i've been from state to state followers tailgate 
keep comin but you came too late but i'll wait 
so back up regroup get a grip come equipped 
you're the next contestant  clap ya hands you won a trip 
the price is right  don't make a deal too soon 
how many notes could you name this tune 
follow the leader is the title theme task 
now ya know you don't have to ask 
rap is rhythm and poetry cuts create sound effects 
you might catch up if you follow the records e wrecks 
until then keep eatin and swallowin 
you better take a deep breath and keep followin 
the leader
i came in the door i said it before
i never let the mic magnatize me no more
but it's biting me fighting me inviting  me to rhyme
i can't hold it back i'm looking for the line
taking off my coat clearing my throat
my rhyme will be kicking it until i hit my last note
my mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
selfesteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
but still say a rhyme after the next one
prepared never scared i'll just bless one
and you know that i'm the soloist
so eric b make 'em clap to this
i don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
no tricks in '86 it's time to build
eric b easy on the cut no mistakes allowed
cuz to me mc means move the crowd
i made it easy to dance to this
but can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
saying indeed that i precede cuz my man made a mix
if he bleed he won't need no bandaid to fix
if they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
i hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
but he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
the party is live the rhyme can't be kept in
side it needs erupting just like a volcano
it ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
because i'm better then the rest of them
eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim
go get a girl and get soft and warm
don't get excited you've been invited to a quiet storm
but now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
and then you ask what have i done lately
first you said all you want is love and affection
let me be your angel and i'll be your protection
take you out buy you all kinds of things
i must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
you caught an attitude you need food to eat up
i'm scheming like i'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
you scream i'm lazy you must be crazy
thought i was a donut you tried to glaze me
funky
i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
music orientated so when hiphop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated
they tried to take it and say that i'm too small
cool 'cause i don't get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then i jet
back to the lab without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the other one then i make another one
to dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i don't need a cigarette know what i mean
i'm raging ripping up the stage and
don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
thought of cuz it's sort ofan addiction
magnatized by the mixing
vocals vocabulary your verses you're stuck in
the mic is a drano volcanoes erupting
rhymes overflowing gradually growing
everything is written in the cold so it can coin
cide my thoughts to guide
48 tracks to slide
the invincible microphone fiend rakim
spread the word 'cause i'm in
 effect
a smooth operator operating correctly
but back to the problem i gotta habit
you can't solve it silly rabbit
the prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
i fiend for a microphone like herion
soon as the bass kicks i need a fix
gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
and i'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness  beware it's the reanamator
a menace to a microphone a lethal weapon
an assasinator if the people ain't stepping
you see a part of me that you never seen
when i'm fiending for a microphone i'm the microphone fiend
verse 2
after 12 i'm worse that a gremlin
feed me hiphop and i start trembling
the thrill of suspense is intense your horrified
by any means neccesary this is what has to be done
make way 'cause here i come
my dj cuts material
grand imperial
it's a must that i bust any mic you're hand to me
it's inherited it's runs in the family
i wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's  back
if that don't slow 'em up i carry a full pack
now i don't want to have to let off you should of kept off
you didn't keep the stage warm step off
ladies and gentleman you're about to see
a pasttime hobby about to be
take it to the maximum i can't relax see i'm
hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one
hell of a antidote something you can't smoke
more than dope you're trying to move away but you can't you're broke
more than cracked up you should have backed up
for those who act up need to be more than smacked up
any entertainer i got a torture chamber
one on one and i'm the remainder
so close your eyes and hold your breath
and i'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death
before you go you'll remember you seen
the fiend of a microphone i'm the microphone fiend
i ain't no joke i use to let the mic smoke
now i slam it when i'm done and make sure it's broke
when i'm gone no on gets on cause i won't let
nobody press up and mess up the scene i set
but think about it then you'll understand
i'm just an addict addicted to music
maybe it's a habit i gotta use it
even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
i hook a beat up convert it into hiphop form
write a rhyme in grafitti and every show you see me in
deep concentration cause i'm no comedian
jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
i treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
another enemy not even a friend of me
cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
competing cause i just put your mind on pause
and i complete when you compare my rhyme with yours
i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned
remember me  the one you got your idea from
but soon you start to suffer the tune'll get rougher
when you start to stutter that's when you had enough of
biting it'll make you choke you can't provoke
you can't cope you shoulda broke because i ain't no joke 
i got a question  it's serious as cancer
who can keep the average dancer
hyper as a heart attack nobody smilin
cause you're expressin the rhyme that i'm stylin
this is what we all sit down to write
you can't make it so you take it home break it and bite
use pieces and bits of all my hiphop hits
get the style down pat then it's time to switch
put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
then you figured you're ready for the neighborhood chores
a emcee don't even try to be
when you come up to speak don't even lie to me
you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate
then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me
so when you see me come up freeze
or you'll be one of those seven mc's
they think that i'm a new jack but only if they knew that
they who think wrong are they who can't do that
style that i'm doin they might ruin
patterns of paragraphs based on you and
your offbeat dj if anything he play
sound familiar i'll wait 'til e say
you can get a smack for this i ain't no joke 
i hold the microphone like a grudge
b'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
i hold a conversation cause when i invent
when i see you i'll kick a freestyle goin steadily
but whatever you do don't miss one
there'll be another rough rhyme after this one
before you know it you're followin and fiendin
waiting for the punchline to get the meanin
like before the middle of my story i'm tellin
nobody beats the r so stop yellin
save it put it in your pocket for later
no interruptions 'til the mic is broke
when i'm gone then you can joke
cause everything is real on a serious tip
keep playin and i get furious quick
and i'll take you for a walk through hell
feed your dome  then watch your eyeballs swell
guide you out of triple stage darkness
when it get dark again then i'ma spark this
microphone cause the heat is on you see smoke
and i'm finished when the beat is gone i'm no joke 
verse one
poets are paranoid dj's dstroyed
cuz i came back to attack others in spite
strike like lightnin' it's quite frightenin'
but don't be afraid in the dark in a park
not a scream or a cry or a bark more like a spark
ya tremble like a  alcoholic muscles tighten up
what's that lighten up you see a sight but
suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick
you grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick
music's the clue when i come your warned
apocolypse now when i'm done ya gone
haven't you ever heard of a mcmurderer
this is the death penaltyand i'm servin' a
death wish so come on step to this
hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
friday the thirteenth walking down elm street
you come in my realm ya get beat
this is off limits so your visions are blurry
all ya see is the meters at a volume 
pumping lyrics of fury
it's a fearified freestyle
terror in the styles never errorfiles
indeed i'm known your exiled
for those that oppose to be level or next to this
i ain't a devil and this ain't the exorcist
worse than a nightmare you don't have to sleep a wink
the pain's a migraine every time ya think
flashbacks interfere ya start to hear
the rakim in your ear
then the beat is hysterical
that makes eric go get a ax and chops the wack
soon the lyrical format is superior
faces of death remain 
mc's decaying cuz they never stayed
the scene of a crime every night at the show
the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
it's only one capable breaks the unbreakable
melodiesunmakable patternunecscapable
a horn if want the style i posses 
i bless the child the earth the gods and bomb the rest
for those that envy a mc it can be
hazardous to your health so be friendly
a matter of life and death just like a ethchasketch
shake 'till your clear make it disappear make the next
after the ceremony let the rhyme rest in peace
if not my soul'll release
the scene is recreated reincarnated updated i'm glad you made it
cuz your about to see a disasterous sight
a performance never again performed on a mic
lyrics of fury
a fearified freestyle
make sure the system's loud when i mention
phrases that's fearsome
you want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums
i sit back and observe the whole scenery 
then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
strictly business i'm quickly in this mood
and i don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
i'm a tear you apart but i'm a spare you a heart
program into the speed of the rhyme prepare to start
rhythm's out of the radius insane as the craziest
musical madness mc ever made see it's
now an emergency openheart surgery
open your mind you will find every word'll be
furier than ever i remain the furture
battle's temptingwhatever suits ya
for words the sentence there's no resemblance
you think you're ruffer then suffer the consequences
i'm never dyingterrifying results
i wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts
mictomouth resuscitation rhythm with radiation
novicane ease the pain it might save him
if not eric b's the judge the crowd's the jury
how do i plead to homicide
lyrics of fury
they're getting furier   a fearified freestyle
verse one
turn up the bass check out my melody hand out a cigar
i'm lettin knowledge be born and my name's the r
akim not like the rest of them i'm not on a list
that's what i'm sayin i drop science like a scientist
my melody's in a code the very next episode
has the mic often distortin ready to explode
i keep the mic in fahrenheit freeze mc's and make em colder
the listener's system is kickin like solar
as i memorize advertise like a poet
keep you goin when i'm flowin smooth enough you know it
but rough that's why the middle of my story i tell eb
verse two
so what if i'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as i sing
one of these for mc's so they don't have to scream
i couldn't wait to take the mic flow into it to test
then let my melody play and then the record suggest
that i'm droppin bombs but i stay peace and calm
any mc that disagree with me just wave your arm
and i'll break when i'm through breakin i'll leave you broke
drop the mic when i'm finished and watch it smoke
so stand back you wanna rap  all of that can wait
i won't push i won't beat around the bush
i wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
you might try but you can't get close to
because i'm number one competition is none
i'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall
i just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
you shouldn't have told me you said you control me
so now a contest is what you owe me
pull out your money pull out your cut
pull up a chair and i'ma tear shit up
so easily will i emcee
some bass and treble is moist scratchin and cuttin a voice
and when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
i wouldn't have came to set my name around the same weak shit
puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit
in a rhyme why waste time on the microphone
i take this more serious than just a poem
rockin party to party backyard to yard
now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods
verse three
the rhyme is rugged at the same time sharp
i can swing off anything even a string of a harp
just turn it on and start rockin mind no introduction
til i finish droppin science no interruption
when i approach i exercise like a coach
usin a melody and add numerous notes
with the mic and the rakim
it's a task like a match i will strike again
rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
put in order to pursue with the momentum except
i say one rhyme and i order a longer rhyme shorter
a pause but don't stop the tape recorder
verse four
i'm not a regular competitor first rhyme editor
melody arranger poet etcetera
extra events the grand finale like bonus
i am the man they call the microphonist
with wisdom which means wise words bein spoken
too many at one time watch the mic start smokin
i came to express the rap i manifest
stand in my way and i'll lead a  words protest
mc's that wanna be dissed they're gonna
be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
all they can go get is me a glass of moet
a hard time sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
i take 7 mc's put em in a line
and add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
well it'll take 7 more before i go for mine
and that's 21 mc's ate up at the same time
easy does it do it easy that's what i'm doin
no fessin no messin around no chewin
no robbin no buyin bitin why bother
this slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow
my unusual style will confuse you a while
if i was water i flow in the nile
so many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's
just because of a cause i have to pause
right after tonight is when i prepare
to catch another sucka duck mc out there
cos my strategy has to be tragedy catastrophe
and after this you'll call me your majesty
my melody
verse five
marley marl synthesized it i memorize it
eric b made a cut and advertised it
my melody's created for mc's in the place
who try to listen cos i'm dissin 
take off your necklace you try to detect my pace
now you're buggin over  off my rhyme like bass
the melody that i'm stylin smooth as a violin
rough enough to break new york from long island
my wisdom is swift no matter if
my momentum is slow mc's still stand stiff
i'm genuine like leather don't try to be clever
so eric b cut it easily
sip the juice cuz i got enough to go around
and the thought takes place uptown
i grew up on the sidewalk where i learned street talk
and then taught to hawk new york
i go to queens for queens to get the crew from brooklyn
make money in manhattan and never been tooken
go uptown and the bronx to boogie down
get strong on the island recoupe and lay around
time to bulid my juice back up
props back up suckers get smacked up
don't doubt the clout you know what i'm about
knocking niggaz off knocking niggaz out
shaking em up waking em up
raking em up breaking em up
standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge
let's see if i know the ledge
corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here
i get cockd liffin' forty's of beer
here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
if i get revenge then they rest in peace
somebody's got to suffer i just might spare one
and give a brother a fair one
and i do work with these like hercules
switch to southpaw split your right jaw
'cause i don't like y'all i'm hype when night fall
smooth but i move like an army
bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
putting brothers to rest like elliot ness
'cause i don't like stress
streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand
nutting's gonna stop the plan
i'll chill like pacino kill like deniro
black gambino die like a hero
living on shaky grounds too close to the edge
let's see if i know the ledge
shells lay around on the battleground
dead bodies are found throughout the town
tried to put shame in my game to make a name i'm a
put it on a bullet put it in your brain
rip the block like a buckshot
who cares where it goes just keep the casket closed
no remorse when a life is lost
i paid my dues paid the cost
and my pockets are still fat
wherever i'm at i get the welcome mat
even if my crew steep with one deep
i attract attention people like to peep
so come say hi to the bad guy
don't say goodbye i don't plan to die
'cause i get loose and i got troops
and crazy juice
in control of many like ayatollah khomeini
hang out wit smith and wesson don't try to play me
i'm at war a lot like anwar sadat
but no warning shot my gun is warm a lot
when i cook beef the smoke will never clear
areas interfere but this here's severe
living life too close to the edge
hoping that i know the ledge
a brand new morn no time to yawn
shower's on power's on
late for school i catch the train
girls sip cristal and whisper my name
i push up like an exercise
check the intellect and inspect the thighs
select the best one pull her to the side 
keep her occupied for the rest of the ride          
read my resume she's know i'm 'ready cool                  
just meet me after school
we can moan and groan until your mom come home
sweatin' me she didn't want to let me loose
come get me that's if you want to sip the juice
cause the streets await me so i take my gun off safety
cause alot of niggaz hate me
coming out of the building they set me up
sprayed wit automatics they wet me up
in a puddle of blood i lay close to the edge
verse one
standing by the speaker suddenly i had this
fever was it me or either summer madness
cuz i just can't stand around
so i get closer and the closer i get the better it sound
my mind starts to activate rhymes collaborate
cuz when i heard the beat i just had to make
something from the top of my head
so i fell into the groove of the wax and i said
how could i move the crowd
first of all ain't no mistakes allowed
here's the instruction put it together
it simple ain't it but quite clever
some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
but weak ideas irritate my ears
is this the best that you can make
cuz if not and you got more i'll wait
but don't make me wait too long coz i'm a move on 
the dancefloor when they put something smooth on
so turn up the bass it's better when it's loud
cuz i like to move the crowd
move the crowd
verse two
imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar
it gets stronger everytime i hold a
microphone check the tone to get started
the line for the microphone is departed
so leave it up to me my dj is mixing
everyone is moving or eager to listen
your hands in the air your mouth shut
cuz i'm on the mic and eric b is on the cut
for those that know me indeed i like to flow
especially when the music's going slow
it gives me a chance to let everybody know
it's time to bust out the rakim show
i'm the intelligent wise on the mic i will rise
right in front of your eyes cuz i am a surprise
so i'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
all praise due to allah and that's a blessing
wit knowledge of self there's nothing i can't solve
at 360 degrees i revolve
this is actual fact it's not an act it's been proven
indeed and i proceed to make the crowd keep moving
move the crowd
let the rhythm hit 'em
i'm the arsenal
i got artillery lyrics of ammo
rounds of rhythm
then i'm 'a give 'em piano
bring a bulletproof vest
nothin' to ricochet
ready to aim at the brain
now what the trigger say
tempos triflin'
felt like a rifle
massage 'n' melodies
might go right through
simultaneously like an uzi
nothin' can bruise me
lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
so reload quickly
and you better hit me
while i'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
you steppin' with 007
better make it snappy
no time to do your hair baby
brothers are bustin' at me
beats and bullets pass me
none on target
they want the r hit
but wtch the god get
quicker the tongue is the trigger
'cause i'm real fast
let off some rhythm at 'em
let 'em feel the blast
penetrate at a crazy rate
this ain't no 38
hit 'em at point blank range
and watch 'em radiate
runnin' out of ammunition
i'm done wit' em
you ask me how i did 'em 
i let the rhythm hit 'em
i push a power that's punishable
better be a prisoner
the hit man is the
brother wit' charisma
showing you that i have
powerful paragraphs
followers will become leaders
but without a path
ya mentally paralyzed
crippled ya third eye
rhymes are blurred
then it occurred that you heard i
reduced the friction with crucifixion
let loose the mix then
boost the piston
eric hit 'em with' some of that
cut like a lumberjack
and me gettin' hit back
it won't be none of that
i'm untouchable
you see me in 3d
when i let the rhythm hit another mc
lyrics made of lead
enters your head
then eruptions of a mass production
will spread when
music is louder
full of gunpower
microphone machinery
when i see a crowd of
party people pumpin'
their fist like this
ya hide in the back
thinkin' that i might miss
but the r is accurate
plus i'm packed up with 
educated punch lines that
i have to hit
whatever i aim at
i line 'em up
ya body is weak feel with pain
that time is up
you been hit with somethin'
different isn't it
rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
nothin' can harm me
why try to bar me
you couldn't come around to rob with a army
you'll get wrecked by the architect
so respect 'em
i disconnect 'em soon as i inject 'em
with radiation
put 'em by the basement
bust his chest open
bash his face in
let it split 'im
since he brought his main man wit' 'im
he ask me how i did 'im
i let the rhythm hit 'im
let it hit 'im
dance floor's dangerous
packed in like a briefcase
rhyth with ral rough rhyme
beats with deep bass
girls with tight pants
maybe they might dance
tonight if the rs on the mike
there's a slight chance
the crowd is crucial
mc's grounds are neutral
now that you're here let me introduce you
get ready
i'm hard read like graffiti but steady
science i drop is real heavy
radiant energy that'll be the penalty
touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
the prescription's one every hour
now it's a havoc
if ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
attention follow directions real close
keep out of reach of children
beware of overdose
too many milligram
but what made a iller jam
my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
that kill a man
i deas for the ear to fear
might split 'im
he'll never forget 'im
he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
at least when he left he'll know what hit 'im
the last breath of the words of death
was the rhythm
now throw you hands in the air and yo go
rakim will do the rest of this slow
if i speed they know you'll blow the hell up
if i slow up catch up hell no
wicked as i kecked it
don't need to remix it
'cause i prefixed it
reversed and switched it
to perform to perfection
section for section
rhymes keep connectin'
ya guessin' what's next an'
blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'cause when i explained ya can't complain for pain
travel through the brain hit a vein
then remain let it radiate
vibes will vibrate
why did you violate
now i'm 'a have to let the style brak
moans now the tone is ingrown
after this here's thrown gimme another microphone
before i get that fifi i met
whisper i wanna reach your intellect
kiss her 'cause i wanna give her the most respect
so i shine and let the write reflect
hold 'er mold 'er make 'er feel older
lay her on my shoulder
eeverything i told her
makes her feel secure whenever i'm wit' 'er
and you know how i did 'er
me and the rhythm hit 'er
verse one
me and eric b was coolin' at the paladium
sorry if you're in a rush  don't let me hold ya up
or interveen or interrupt but  
you got the look  i wanna get to know ya better
i had to let her know  but yo i didn't sweat her
'cause if you woulda seen what i was seein'
almost looked korean but european
when she spoke her accent was selfexplanatory 
even her body language told the story
her name was mahogony  twin's name was ebony
so we could talk and see new york
show time doesn't start until one o'clock
and once i entered your mind i wouldn't wanna stop
caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
calm ya nerves massage ya brain
each mic is a mineral poetry's protein
verse is a vitamin  affects like codine
so tell me how you feel and i'll reveal 
a pill that'll heal ya pain  'cause i'm real
she musta oh deed 'cause she couldn't resist
she spoke slowly when she told me this she said
chorus
over me she's goin' crazy
she'll rub me on my chest and call me mr sexy
she said she'd have my kids and help me make my next g
tell me i ain't finesse mahogony   
verse two
so i prescribed her something to revive
and surprise her she's liver and much more wiser
than the light i shine when my brain cells spark
come to me so we can glow in the dark
and soon you can represent the moon
as long as i keep ya in tune
i'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
it's funny  how time flies when ya havin' fun
we got close and it was almost one
she kissed me slow but you know how far a kiss can go
fck around and miss the show
so i told her to hold that thought real tight
we can finish where we left off later on tonite
back to the scene of the crime on time
as they introduced the 'fiend of the rhyme'
she stood with a birdseye view of me
thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
the back of the room i could see her eyes gloom
patient but hopin' that the show was over soon
as the place was ripped in half she made her way to the front row
i packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
the speakers were blown plus my mic was sore
besides i got places to go ladies to see
and she could tell me how crazy she was over me
we drove off  she said she liked the way that i performed
and couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm' i said
looks i received made it hard to mc
i can take a hint so i knew that she
showed her some sights then i took her to the condo
she was pipin' hot but i kept my calm so
she asked how come i don't smile
as we reached the kingdom she said bring some
champagne she'll entertain then sing some
sentimental songs real gentle 
it hit the spot and you know where it went to
as we embraced i felt her heart pumpin'
i knew she was in the mood for somethin'
so i laid on my back and relaxed
it wasn't the perignon that made her collaspe
over me
planet earth was my place of birth
born to be the soul controller of the universe
besides the part of the map i hit first
any environment i can adapt when it gets worst
the rough gets goin the goin gets rough
when i start flowin the mic might bust
the next state i shake from the power i generate
people in cali used to think it was earthquakes
cause times was hard on the boulevard
so i vote god and never get scarred and gauled
but it seems like i'm locked in hell
lookin over the edge but the r never fell
a trip to slip cause my nikes got grip
stand on my own two feet and come equipped
any stage i'm seen on or mic i fiend on
i stand alone and need nothin to lean on
going for self with a long way to go
so much to say but i still flow slow
i come correct and i won't look back
cause it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
i learn to relax in my room and escape from new york
and return through the womb of the world as a thought
thinkin how hard it was to be born
me bein cream with no physical form
millions of cells with one destination
to reach the best part as life's creation
nine months later a job well done
make way cause here i come
since i made it this far i can't stop now
there's a will and a way and i got the knowhow
to be all i can be and more
and see all there is to see before
i'm called to go back to the essence
it's a lot to learn so i study my lessons
i thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
i'm glad i listened when my father was rappin to me
cause back in the days they lived in caves
exiled from the original man they strayed away
now that's what i call hard times
i'd rather be here to exercise the mind
then i take a thought around the world twice
from knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
across the desert that's hot as the arabian
but they couldn't cave me in cause i'm the asian
reachin for the city of mecca visit medina
visions of nefertiti then i seen a
mind keeps traveling i'll be back after
i stop and think about the brothers and sisters in africa
return the thought through the eye of a needle
for miles i thought and i just brought the people
under the dark skies on a dark side
not only there but right here's an apartheid
so now is the time for us to react
take a trip through the mind and when you get back
understand your third eye seen all of that
it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
no more props i want property in every borough
nobody's stoppin me because i'm thorough
rhymes i make gimme real estate for me to own
wherever i bless a microphone
doubleohseven is back and relaxin
on point and reactin and ready for action
i'm so low key that you might not see me
incognito and takin it easy ghetto
quiet as kept on a hush hush
in front of a crowd i get loud there's a bumrush
be calm keep a low pro and play the background
hopin the whack rapper put the mic back down
so rip it break it in half go 'head and slam it
cause when it's time to build i'm a mechanic
of bondin and mendin attachin and blendin
so many solos there is no endin
people in my neighborhood they know i'm good
from london to hollywood wherever i stood
footprints remain on stage ever since
sidewalks and streets i leave fossils and dents
when i had sex i left my name on necks
my trademark was left throughout the projects
i used to get rich when i played clo
so i collect my cash then slide
i've got my back my gun's on my side
it shouldn't have to be like that
i guess it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
even the ghetto
i'm from the ghetto
word up
casualties of war
casualties of war as i approach the barricade
where's the enemy  who do i invade
bullets of teflon bulletproof vest rip
tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
cause i got a family that waits for my return
to get back home is my main concern
i'ma get back to new york in one piece
but i'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
sky lights up like fireworks blind me
bullets whistlin over my head remind me
president bush said attack
flashback to nam i might not make it back
missile hits the area screams wake me up
from a war of dreams heat up the m16
basic training trained for torture
take no prisoners and i just caught ya
addicted to murder send more bodybags
they can't identify em leave the nametags
i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor
casualties of war 4x
day divides the night and night divides the day
it's all hard work and no play
more than combat it's far beyond that
cause i got a kill or be killed kind of attack
area's mapped out there'll be no stratego
me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
but what are we here for  who's on the other side of the wall
somebody give the president a call
but i hear warfare scream through the air
back to the battlegrounds it's war they declare
a desert storm let's see who reigns supreme
something like monopoly a government scheme
go to the army be all you can be
another dead soldier  hell no not me
so i start letting off ammunition in every direction
allah is my only protection
but wait a minute saddam hussein prays the same
and this is asia from where i came
i'm on the wrong side so change the target
shooting at the general and where's the sergeant
blame it on john hardy hawkins for bringing me to america
now it's mass hysteria
i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor
casualties of war 4x
the war is over for now at least
just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
it's a long way home it's a lot to think about
whole generation left in doubt
innocent families killed in the midst
it'll be more dead people after this
so i'm glad to be alive and walkin
half of my platoon came home in coffins
except the general buried in the storm
in bits and pieces no need to look for em
i played it slick and got away with it
rigged it up so they would think they did it
now i'm home on reserves and you can bet
when they call i'm going awol
cause it ain't no way i'm going back to war
when i don't know who or what i'm fighting for
so i wait for terrorists to attack
every time a truck backfires i fire back
i look for shelter when a plane is over me
remember pearl harbor  new york could be over g
kamikaze strapped with bombs
no peace in the east they want revenge for saddam
did i hear gunshots or thunder
no time to wonder somebody's going under
put on my fatigues and my camoflouge
take control cause i'm in charge
when i snapped out of it it was blood dead bodies on the floor
kill him again
try to identufy the man in front of ya
but it ain't the role the gear or the money the
swift intellectionist with pleny ya
bite if it's dark i'll spark every one of ya
i throw a mic in the crowd it's a question
i got the answer it includes directions
attack your wack 'till it's handicapped
you'll never hold the mic again try to hand it back
cuz every rapper that comes i cut off his thumbs
put a record to his neck if he swallows it hums
slice from ear to earso 'till can hear better
before he bleed to death here hear every letter
and you can see quick and thick the blood can get
if you try to change the style or the subject
as i get deep in the rhyme i'm becomin' a
emcee murdererbefore i'm done i'm a
prepare the chamber the torture's comin' up
trip through the mind at the end you'll find it's
the punisher
kill 'em again
i hold the mic as hostage emcees are ransome
rhymes'll punish 'em cuz they don't undertsand 'em
i heat up his brain then explain then i hand him
a redhot microphonethat's how i planned 'em
rhymes call information unite midnught
like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic
if ya curse me it ain't no mercy
give him a autopsy killed by a verse of me
i took a kid and cut off his eyelid
kill him slow so he could see what i did
and if he don't understand what i said
i'm pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head
so he can see what he's getting into
a part of the mind that he never been through
a journey is coming cuz ya getting sent to 
a place harder to find but it's all in the mental
i ran a brainscan to locate his game plan
when i'm through with his brain he ain't the same man
did he lose his mind or lost in his mind
but this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find
your foundation coasting your mind is
drifting in slow motionfrozen
looks like another murder at the mardi gras b
too late to send out a search party
once ya out of ya head then ya can't get back
i give 'em a map but he still get trapped so
prepare the chamber the torture's coming up
trip through the mind at the end you'll find it's the punisher
kill 'em again
dangerous rhymes are performed like surgery
cuts so deep you'll be bleeding burgundy
my intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex
your cerebellum is next 
your conscience becomes subconscious
soon your response is nonsense
the last words are blurredmumbled then slurred
then your verbs are no longer heard
you get your lung fried so good you're tonguetied
he couldn't swing or hang so he hung 'till he died
reincarnate him and kill him againagain and againagain and again
i leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him
i got a deadmc'ing museum
when i create 'em i cremate 'em and complicate 'em
you can't save 'emthere's no ultamatum
mic's lay around full of ashes with the victim's name in slashes
got a long list and i'm a get every one of ya
beware of the punisher
then i'm a kill 'em again
wake 'em up kill 'em again

chorus 
so if you love to get your party on 
and you feel that your game is strong 
and you get mad when the broads is gone

women who love roll their hips when i'm holding this 
 
instrumental chorus

bite this i might flip spread a billion plagues 
put medicine in it before i kill ya dead

could you walk no at least you thought though 
auto fours blow a hole in your torso 
damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow 
try to say something now i thought so 
i leave emcee's bleeding while i'm fleeing across seain 
start breeding double my swiss cheese in sweden

1st verse 
levantore 
yeah it's just ghetto kid test the devil to hit the next level 
wish they was a rebel with cerebral metal 
inflex the bezzle with the peddle to the metal 
in a thug's paradise where love have a price 
so we love for life like thugs love the night 
they sell drugs for ice for the benz with bug lights 
some hug mics to the world hung like parasites 
the likes lethal the mics lead you 
a sneak preview watch what we do and what the hood teach you 
i still see through the eye of a needle 
so i can watch people cause slug backwards is evil 
 
2nd verse 
levantore 
yo what's this yo bust this yo it's time to up lift

panhandling with your mans and them 
scrambling gambling plans to win 
while the cops clock em thieves flock em

ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters 
and still get vicious for the thugs and the misses

but i take advantage and take you for granted 
call collect explainin' why i ain't came yet 
i ain't winnin' the game yet can i get a rain check 
blow me a kiss in the wind i'm missin' again 
don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end 
talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear 
make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there 
somewhere around ladies know i get lonely and proud 
open my file baby you should know me by now 
tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites 
find my place in life plus i like to hold mics 
it might be seven whole days and seven whole nights

i know too much of any thing is bad whatever 
long as we have good and bad times together 
bad times make the good times that much better

you like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night 
features of a queen and your mind frame is tight 
timin' is right get ready for the time of your life 
you speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds 
apparently we know it's no guarantee 
but losin' you boo who smooth as you 
you unusual this is for the cool in you 
and for the chill i will forever come real 
your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed 
all it took was one look one kiss one meal 
now come feel let's make this a done deal

1st verse

ayeyo i'm a terrorize charge and slay shows

on the turntable sound like tornadoes 
my style is performed like tropical storms 
your not to get on the whole spot will get torn 
i keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in 
keep the models following wise as king solomon 
come slow through the jungle like an animal 
invade any land i go like general hannibal 
from long island to queens light up the new york scenes 
all the way to new orleans and everything in between 
left to go bless a show in mexico 
next thing i know it's extra cold i see eskimo's 
time to rock get it hot soon as i get in there 
spit in they ear so flow they froze and i disappear 
 
chorus 2x

2nd verse 
they said i was a head of my time or either here before 
to see the idea clear it takes a year or more 
now times that by the years i reign straightseven 
no hear for four years still multiplied by eleven 
the silence's a set back make em regret that 
one way to get back is violence and wet cats 
but hold your head black or i'll never rap again 
just when i thought i was out they pulled me back in 
now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering 
then i'm a go back to the gat and racketeering 
my sabotage is camaflouge and espionage 
you ain't havin ra so don't test the god 
i'm takin' all orders i can't afford extorters 
i hit em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters 
so warn a friend tell em it's on again 
if it's a freestyle bust in a park i want in 
 
chorus 2x 
it's a must that i bust any mic that you hand to me 
it's inherited it runs in the family

2nd verse 
here we come now 
turntable spin like a merrygoround 
never slow down depending on how good your stereo sounds 
set it up in the hood where we go surround 
tearin' through towns turn 'em into burial grounds 
this is the track that made theodore wanna scratch 
the track that caused the first kid to spin on his back 
and then we saw kids spraypainting the wall 
while some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law 
it's no antidote it's what you can't provoke 
so just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke 
and take a real hit soon as it bang you feel quick 
it's real thick this is that ol' real shit 
this is the description of designs for you to listen to 
reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular 
keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee 
have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40 
 
chorus 
from the streets below to everything above 
to the heart that pumps rakim allah's blood 
i swear i kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug

and i'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
 
3rd verse 
you know what this is

vicious visions is not for motion pictures 
unstoppable rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas 
or witcha missus gettin tropical kisses

suck her neck or just peck better to funk it 
the ep is in effect from dusk to sunset 
she want a rim shot all over her drum set 
jump the bed rubbin' your head it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset 
hell no doomstick big as a elbow 
gel soft well blow give him a minute he'll grow 
and all you gotta do is play the track again

chorus 
from the streets below to everything above

i'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert 
in twentytwo yards per second to catch me to daily delicatessen 
it takes me thirty minutes to eat'em forty minutes to digest'em 
and fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
so ask yourself a questionwhat question 
can the canibus rhyme 
is a fuckin porcupine half swine 
no time to make up your mind you wanna run or die
clip you while you're running by trip you up from behind 
my rhymes confuse niggas 
like somebody try to gangbang 
wearin' a blue shirt and red pants throwin' up signs with there left hand 
standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
god dam eggplants niggas getting' me vexed man 
cause i'm surrounded by garbage like fred sav 
and i can't seem to get away from it 
i dreamed that i stabbed leviathan through the stomach and ate from it 
in my past life i slayed hundreds and in the life before that 
i played trumpets to warn you that i was comin' 
there's one billion ways to die and i already tried 
ninehundred million nine hundred and ninety nine 
when i aim and fire my rhymes like a hundred cannon balls flying 
striking you one at a time in a parallel line 
while the art of emceeing is steady dying 
canibus and rakim allah is still in there prime 
 
chorus 
from the streets below to everything above 
to the heart that pumps rakim allah's blood 
i swear i kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
you emcee's is playing tugawar with your tongues 
from the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
i'm number one and competition is still none 
and i'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
before the dough came my whole aim was blow like propane
control the whole domain and then show no shame
make rappers go  and they so lame playin with no game
put em on the lil plane til they can't claim no fame
i got the range better stay in the slow lane
i make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain
your thoughts are so plane i rearrange your whole frame
until my whole name grow out your brain like rogaine
letter by letter i put words together
once merged apart never they be heard forever
and then i grab a pen and stab him in his abdomen
and smash him in throw his mic like a javelin
then i explain verses that remain on the surface
at times it get deep but i never defeat the purpose
never go out to go the dough route forever hold out
i never sold out for any amount no doubt
chorus rakim repeat 2x
that's how i get down so tell me how you like that
i hit the town hold it down on a tight track
i start a party now  everybody like rap
haters are mad cause they gave the r the mic back
i like to hang where e'rythang seem to happen at y'know
it's ra's habitat i'm like that czar arafat
and yes i have a gat snap like a israeli
a terrorist i never miss blowin up kids daily
i step to writers and let my virus hurt the closest
i'm sick as hepatitis and worse than tuberculosis
pull out a pen like a grenade and drop it quick
i strike again and i'ma get paid exotic shit
you know the god ra be hot as the mojave
swing like king usabi my posse be kamikaze
on the corners like i'm homeless and i don't know where home is
the bonus is where the next open microphone is
me and my team vision like a radar screen
intervene and yo cut the mic off cause ra fiend
to show the whole world some of the things i seen
then blow it up like edi amin yaknahmean
chorus
i do a thang thang i write the songs they sing
make sure that they swing from new york to beijing
put your thoughts in the sling and your brain is gangrene
pull in the ring repeatin and sayin the same thing
xerox zero no match you ditto
copy machine couldn't reprint my 
my new style that i produce now's beyond twothou'
i knew how since a juvenile to make a kapow
when the night's fallin i can hear the mic callin
i like ballin i cut back like mic jordan
this is for y'all while i'm spittin literatures
lyrics'll ball like allen iverson dribble the ball
they hopeless  whoever approaches my high explosives
my vision sadicious and freestyle's ferocious
i wrote this words flew over my head like a locust
i turned the beat up sat back and stayed focused
one two
yeah uhh yeah
yeah it's the god baby
long island's own
barbarian of the microphone
it's for y'all niggaz
and the streets just a couple of miles east of mecca
where peeps touch nuttin but style heat and cheddar
compete witcha livelihood to eat better
and ain't nuttin sweet but the ladies who speak wetta
with a torn smile tryin to get my song on file
it's on now the whole town done gone wild
kick rhymes off my heartbeat as a unborn child
then developed a strong style on long isle
won't be long now i started rhymin young
i designed for fun knowin my time would come
i started payin dues djin with crews
learnin the inner city rules conveyin the news
soon as the jam start the man's art'll jam parks
slam so hard it remains a landmark
the rhyme that i'm stylin smooth as a violin

like any god loose on a spree for new degrees
things to do and see until nuttin is new to me
a true mc usually be into a breeze
and i can still see new york city through the trees
my advance slams put you outside lookin in
or the other way around that depends look again
took a pen so you could zero in on my book of gems
it extends from the hamptons to brooklyn
through every hoodie in town to learn the boogie down
til every dj around wanted to put me down
rhymes got rougher til i was ready to blast off
and harass all from suffolk county to nassau
where we keep the money pilin keep the honies smilin
keep the heater just in case kids start whylin
the rhyme that i'm stylin smooth as a violin

grew up in wyndanch formerly known as crimedanch
me and my mans we travel lands to find jams
where violence usually ends in sirens
by all means we all fiend for finance
we make cash on the street called straight path
we take class build with the gods with great math
everyday true to the street and never fronted
along the way learned from the best that ever done it
bein exposed to life's highs and lows
got my flows ready for shows i'm ready for the pros
i put it on a tape and then the city i tested
then on the radio the r's requested
now the whole world's whylin all the girls smilin
you know it's on soon as they let the crowd in
the rhyme that i'm stylin smooth as a violin
word up i wanna give a big up to long island stompin grounds f'real

crimedanch one love baby word up 

i wanna give a crazy shout out to all the dj's back in the day
who used to let me smoke they microphones yaknahmean
big up to dj maniac dj teddy tuff and dj cool breeze

word up
yeah it's the god rakim
word up i'm blazin this out to all my comrades
yanamean from the slums of new york to the gutters all over the world
this is for y'all
through my travels i try to take righteous steps
because right or left could mean life or death
no matter how trife it get my sights is set
but it's twice the threat when the nights is death
my mental windows refuse to close they get exposed
to the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
a deadly plague spreadin negativity viciously
unto every city be in ghetto misery
don't let it get to me the writer be left to die
but it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
shines enormous from pure revered kool's and garments
but it's torment jealousy drug wars or warring
tallying slowly turnin into barbarians
more scary when the whole boulevard's carryin
livin in the world of sin my ghetto girls and men
waiting for the world to end
 2x
i see destruction even little kids trust none
they bust guns that's what they get a rush from
when i see em we build and have a real discussion
i got demands for livin can't stand division
make grands on my mission till everything glisten
women in the expedition no plans for prison
in a vision the city get 2 milleni g
sittin in my msc sippin hennesy
so i asked him why wit a fast reply
so i wait here for my maker till it's time to go
wit this dime i know
wit all of her girls and all of my mens
chorus 2x
shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky and never cry
but the streets left him to die now it's death in his eye
livin a sin of hitmen a sinister grin
from beginning to end in it to win
evil rebels doin what we doin in the ghetto
thinkin if we was thorough we can deceive the devil
you can't win your life be end try again
that's what i said when i realized i had a gift
to uplift and be one of allah's advocates
teach the youth and speak the truth
show em what peace can do when ill reach for you
and my reward won't be jewels or cheese it's even better
i can be one of the greatest mc's ever
if i tell em they intelligent women and great men
and live stop waitin for the world to end
chorus 2x
yeah
it don't stop
yeah
check it out
it don't stop
come on
chorus
we love to flirt
to chase the skirts
get to know who we are
girls in the park
cuz when we in the club
we keep it extra hot
they love the whips the chicks
the neighborhood superstars
boys on the block
thugs in the hood we don't never stop
never stop
i go where the masses go
we all act natural
think rational
those  some blow
cats have to know
master your craft
stash your dough
stay on the low
but never be the last to know
the next level or plateau be international
the grass'll grow 
you know 
cash'll flow
ask a pro
do the math
get it fast or slow
your girl's passin gold like a fashion show
the sun'll shine
make it feel like the summertime
shorty's runnin' blind
lookin like they just done a crime
click's want they pockets thick
cop a 
proper chick
street scholarships
politic your dollars quick
 we 
cuz we was the first in the pack
now it's worse than that
so i observe the 
let my words attack
until it  the rap
until the earth collapsed
chorus
you know it seem like life's just begun
my lust is young
i wanna find me a lovely hon 
crush me one
bust a 
mouth to mouth resuscitation
let her hug
and when i'm done
tongue touch me 'til i'm numb
but first the outcome is income and then some
get enough to run and spend some for fun
then me and my thugs 
we come in the club
we swung lovely
watch how big the buzz be 
trust me son
every ghetto got game in it 
fame in it
we remain in it
waitin for the main event
like the days on the corner
we watch the world go by
on the nights that wasn't right
like when a good friend died
yo the street's got a deadly hum
like a drug
we gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love
from the park to the block
to your favorite spot
it don't stop
chorus
i spend the prowl
i been on since a child
it don't make sense to browse
it's intensive now
women in crowds
i search for the gem in the 
who stay original
even when the friends around
since her style
always commands a smile
and her femme fatale
cause men to growl
i take precedent of principle
then arouse
still the treasure is rakim
the smooth criminal
damn it's on
keep my hands on
this amazon
legs for marathons
voice like sarah vaughan
precise alright
i like when her  entice
with a spice of life
flow times twice as nice
and when she go shop

shock the whole block
she so hot
i clothes shop
put it on lock
body that won't drop
bounce like hiphop
it don't stop
 
god mc 
look what y'all made me do 
 
it don't matter if i ain't on the page you want 
tell me what you want i give it to you the way you want 
show you how to flow and how to flip any phrase you want 
you just keep your eye on me 
i show you how to emcee 
 
if it's swag or the lyric display you want 
tell me what you want i give it to you the way you want 
show you how to throw and how to rip any stage you want 
i can show you how to emcee 
like you got a degree 
 
this is your qu'ran or bible 
to be a true mc icon and idol 
the contents you put in your songs are vital 
like training for the ufc you want a title 
slam thoughts on the canvas flip 'em and pin 'em 
metaphors and similes with synonyms in 'em 
spit heat around the town the more you get it heard 
till you spit at least 3000 miles before it hit a curve 
then flaunt your rhymes in your rap pages 
wordplay to punchlines and catchphrases 
deep sport for players and ballers new game 
street talk straight off the corners new slang 
i got heat for crowds for those that pursue it 
spitters i show you flow till your vocals are through it 
from social to freestyle just focus into it 
if you a g i'll show you how the coppola do it 
 
forever sick like catchin aids is 
in a class for greatness for matchin phrases 
my predicates last for pages 
every letter fit trendsetter like fashion statements 
recruits get a shine and they hope forever 
i wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put together 
soon as i make 'em rappers take 'em 
analyze 'em for days and paraphrase 'em 
i'm back hiphoppers'll back my scripts and documents 
raps hit the block it's a wrap it's the apocalypse 
the hood give my rap flow names 
like 911 and crack cocaine 
i hit the building it get hotter in 'em 
it's like birds most rappers don't know how to flip 'em 
i gotta hip 'em get hop and show 'em how to spit 'em 
i bust a rhyme and i school 'em for free i scholarship 'em 
 
competition know the deal you're not ready now 
because you're dealin with the r know how it's goin down 
this is it if you so sick where your skills at 
no sir ghostwriter you can kill that 
 
it's hard    it isn't in bars it's infinite 
so ra deliver it far different 
part lyricist part instrument 
start spittin it the more articulate y'all rhythms get 
till every syllable you drop it pivotal 
if it's not original it's not as memorable 
ill lyrical till you're so popular they sick of you 
pandemical threat level 5 it's critical 
kill 'em off with a word like euthanasia 
till it spread to the youth in asia 
in the booth i'm major my music's monumental i'm a mogul 
you wanna make sense i'ma show you 
you gotta put your life in them lines 
make the deaf hear give sight to the blind 
make your flow tighter brightest designs 
so if the mic is your grind then biting's a crime

while i count the next bundle that's right
a threat yet humble about to flex muscle

'cause every other day i'm in another state
it's like i cross the thin line between love and hate
but i gotta eat gotta get another plate
so i'm on my cake walk for the cake
just stay outta my waaaay
it's what they do
hey yo this right here man 
is like a documentary of a gangsta man
the rise and fall
hook
how them boys gone play me they must be crazy
baby you better pay me
how them actors gone act up like i ain't got back up
back up before you get smacked up
why they wanna play games with me
they don't know that i'm crazy
i don't know what they thinking
they must have been drinking but look i'm that kingpin
he said slow paper is your alto it's like spitting
currency is all about floss like he can't eat his cake
and he starve when the count low
he call the lab the bakery he all about dough
stuffing bread his pockets is hungry
you talking nonsense unless the topic is money
he call a hundred dollars a honey
mami's he called them dimes
so his mind is on his money
but mami's is on his mind
like an og focus on the come up
think he f'ing around he approach you with the gun up
roll the blunt up and forget it happened
stash the dollars bag the product and get it cracking
he get pies he flipping them
tricks he tricking them he call them heffers
he hugh heffing them he pimping them
 he getting the ones for the connects
so have the ones correct when he come to collect
but here he come
hook
that sound like blood money
and i ain't just talking double dubbs club money
i'm talking drug money move out the hood money
double up money you can catch a slug money
this kid will murder you more than a business
if you live it for revenue it's principle never personal
get rid of you if you blocking the bigger picture
he on the blocking thinking of gwop and getting richer
he flips some urban blue play with them keys
for them cnotes so he can handle the whole piano
hammers unloading ammo if his army ain't in harmony
he kill his own famo like tony soprano
he's trying to take it from mine and majored in grind
but the caper is mine it's made up and die for the paper
crime is second nature when you love cash
doing dirty he turn the ave into a blood bath
here he come
hook
the heater buss that mean the reaper coming
drug money keep them bugging not the trees he puffing
streets is buzzing about the repercussion
but he so much in love with his bread the beef is nothing
he got metals for war just like a veteran
but now he bringing cheddar in more than he ever been
banked up he stepped his hustle pimp smoked cold crack
heroin game up american gangster
sleep with the fish while he rather loot and
you like balling he like stealing and shooting
comrades customers competition connects
and hustlers is wishing and plotting the day of his death
what's his focus keys is even when karma catching up
it's hard to set him up he's always holding heaters
but yo they know his weakness so they gave that bread to him
somebody put a gun to his head guess what he said to them
ladies and gentlemen ghettos all across the world
the man above been talking to me
he said he understands my view
he's always walking with me
cuz he sees what i've been through
when the world starts kicking me around
all in my face make me want to put 'em down
trying to earn trying to learn trying to love like a man
sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands
i'm from the hood that's forever sinning
where life is took for granted here so death is winning
nothing but blues around feels like we're losing out
times that spent in this environment confuse a child
as a juvenile i ran wild i ran out of blessings
been in and out of prison as an adolescent
my goal was getting it til something said to turn my life around
redirect my hustle and go legitimate
til i get corporate and invest fortunes
with exec bosses sitting behind a desk at the office
i'm left jobless nobody hiring exconvicts
that don't mean i'm less conscious
it's so hard when they close doors
and when you looking like a so called hip hoppa you get nada
stereotyped scarred for life stigmata
but still a kid's gotta get a dolla
i tackle choices every day that's hopeless
fast money cars and broads will mislead you
love backwards here is evol but it's legal
multitask i make a fortune faster
keep rhymin til i'm climbing up the corporate ladder
in my community you've gotta go out of your way if you're out to get paid
than back up and wait for opportunity
i try not to blame society
i eat my pride cuz i know deep inside it's me
but not entirely when a man try to live righteously
and propriety turn to anxiety
i thought i paid back the system when i stayed in prison
left the stripes see what success is like
but the way they set the price
you spent your childhood in the wild hood
you're in debt for life
i figured out what was talking with me
when i do right i feel him walking with me
so i'm adamant some call it arrogance
i can cope it cuz i know i'm broke for having sense
but my back's against the wall it's getting rough to get a buck
in a job with a minimum wage won't get enough
faced with giving up and my lady friend's beefing
ends ain't meeting we just an argument away from splitting up
it gets lonely my fam disowned me
called me the black sheep cuz i act street
yea it's that deep i tried to change clicks
homies flipped on me cuz i don't hang we have beef
but i'm at peace so that cease at least
i ain't got no ties on my porsche ride
and no time for no crime knowing that the most high
is watching with a close eye
they say i'm from the hood
chorus samuel christian
you and i will always be together
peace or war no matter the weather
me and you like birds of a feather
til the wind blows us away
we stand talk while they fall together
none left i formation like the letter
model and the shelter it's built for whatever
til the wind blows us away
from the beginning it felt like we been in love
we took a chance knowing how slim it was
the world is ours now let's split it up
and you know how short life is let's big it up
let's get fitted up get it in and live it up
dinner plus the cinema then lets hit the club
posting up like both of us is spending ones
cause we ain't get it if it didn't come in him and hers
chemistry together just like a recipe 
or destiny we was meant to be together
don't worry about me going left or doing you wrong
we right for each other it's a beautiful bond
we hug and touch we love and lust
we last through the bashes we cuss and fuss
until we trust the love it's just for us
until its ashes to ashes and dust to dust
chorus
in each others arms it's like heroin love
that dope fiend forever in love
but it's better than drugs
it's heavy on the heart it's still a risk
but we never fall apart we was built for this
nothing that we can't sort out it's brought up
and thought out erase all doubt go hard and all out
you and my fam fall out most of your family can't stand me
we can't let that cross out our family plans can we
we won't get no love from it
let's just keep it one hunnid 'til we one hunnid
stack grands 'til we grandparents
whatever work but let's hope for the best and expect the worst
cause we'll have good and bad times together
but the bad will make the good times that much better
so let's absolve it 'til we sprawled out in coffins
and 2012 if the world fall out the orbit
chorus
we go together like criminals and crime
instrumentals and rhymes
clothes and trends like real g's and dimes
stone gems and shine real cream and pies
chrome rims and rides like ill teams and grinds
like identical designs the pinnacle to rise
like flows and ants like skill dreams and drive
home in france like a little trees and vibes
close as kin or like heels jeans and thighs
since i was rocking giseles you was hotter than hell
now it's me and you like barack and michelle
denzel and pauletta prevail when all weather
stand tall while they fell and fall together
the pleasure and the pain the pressure and the hate
through whatever we together like forever and a day
checks and dollar signs the love for paper
better yet like father time and mother nature
chorus
i told you from the rip
we gone do what we do you know what i mean
it's me and you you and i
in the words of the late great martin luther king
won't be long uh huh
uh uh

 tracey horton  w ad libs
it won't be long 'til the trouble and the struggle is gone
the hustle make the struggle get gone
it's hard to make a move we strugglin
everybody hate to lose but they love to win
it won't be long 'til the world sings the words to our song
that way we forever live on
back on my grind i'm hustlin
it's just a matter of time and i'll come up again
they told me hustle never prolong
but i got caught up in the struggle like a slow song uh huh
'cause my love and respect for this is so strong
i question the state of hiphop uh major labels etc and so on uh
the show'll go on still fiend to get my blow on
but if it's like this then i might quit
but hold on uh this can only go wrong but for so long uh huh
get right quick or i might flip
try to keep a tight lip not to complain
ramblin mind scramblin 'cause patience ain't blockin the pain uh uh
mic sick lyrics is still locked in the brain uh huh
like mike vick sittin in jail watchin the game uh
i wait 'til the day i can play my position yeah
or should i say the die i obey my addiction uh huh
then complete my legacy uh
without compromisin my artistic integrity come on
  w ad libs
so when they ask where i go from here go 'head
the road and the goal is clear uh but it's so severe uh
sometimes i feel like lettin go i swear
i had setbacks my whole career straight y'all
messin with my grind's like messin with my mind
but yo i'm still breathin so i guess it's just a sign uh huh
but it's meaning to the message in the lines word up
some things happen for a reason like a blessing in disguise
but success was in my eyes the shine was blindin me
the fame a little bit of change it took some time to see
the lesson for the wise profit more
time to be a record and the prize was poppin off
finally i made a couple of moves got my own label got to get it
me and a couple of dudes we at the dope table let's get that money
took a oath to stay true now it's an empire
put out the new rakim album and it's fire

major stressin but we wait for blessings
long as the federal reserve still paper pressing
i wrote the plot for gettin this cabbage in the hood
where the average cat can triple his status in the hood
don't stop 'til we livin lavish in the hood
i'm like barack with the stimulus package in the hood
  w ad libs
  w rakim ad libs until fade
it won't be long 'til the trouble and the struggle is gone
the hustle make the struggle get gone
it won't be long 'til the world sings the words to our song
holy are you
there is no god but you
praised be the lord
for those who find it hard to believe and it is
why they call me the god mc the lyricist
trace this down to the roots from genesis
the world wonder i'm still standing like pyramids
design so vivid every brick it got a story to tell
my rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic
mind prolific infinite like mathematic
the first language now add that and add graphics
then go let the blocks know it's the gospel
life's new manual so watch close
the new michelangelo and pablo picasso
prepared to show you the cosmos and rock flows
even my lyrical metaphysical
what this'll do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle
you find your mind too farfetched for it to fathom
i bring the darkness to the light split the atom
it's like watching the big bang theory emerge
i take titles bond them to reveal new words
they want a clear view
from the farthest and the darkest corners of the universe
to a corner near you
a pharaoh in ghetto apparel stay blinged up
fort knox display a modern day king tut
wrapped tight rap like i've been preserved in time
spit the holy water then touch it and turn it to wine
it's the god
we were children of the most high so we fell
from paradise to holy hell
probably descendants of the holy grail
another part of history they won't reveal
times'll only tell
you waiting for judgment it came
in the form of a thug in the game
to create a strong position there's blood in my vein
the chemical is identical we one and the same
with seven letters in all three of my government names
walk on water nah neither did jesus
it's a parable to make followers and readers believers
from egypt to budapest rakim is the truest left
understand the scriptures like the minister louis f
i told you who god is you ignored me like most the prophets
jesus solomon abraham moses and muhammad
i showed the scholars we'll fulfill the broken promise
i spit this truth to predict the future like nostradamus
like revelations i'm hoping my quotes reveal
the seven spirits of god when i open the seal
interpret the holy quran these flows will guide you
translate the torah and decode the bible
warn the elders in the mosques masons and the law
the seven churches the synagogues it's the renaissance
skin is bronze like the messiah
rakim allah's about to reveal a bigger secret than time and the god
satisfaction guaranteed
uhh i got it good neo
i put product in the street

through your blood stream quicker than d
i got what ya'll need satisfaction guaranteed
i got what ya'll need

i bag it up and get it cracking in clubs
go on tours like i'm trafficking drugs
i got what ya'll need
who want musical narcotics that all got it
bomb product it's all profit when ya'll cop it
any hood or any city i'm pumping in
any slum i'm in my customers come again
spit flow by the boat load like i'm colombian
my shipments go out to bring the money in
like supplies that fly to peru to buy bricks
go out my way so biters can't do what i spit
like freddy told priest in that superfly flick
player you always got some superfly shhhhh
i put product in the street
it sell quicker than weed
i spit it raw like i'm flipping a key
i got what ya'll need satisfaction guaranteed
i got pure for the fiends

through your blood stream quicker than d
i got what ya'll need satisfaction guaranteed
it ain't a city i ain't moving weight in
the world wonder my product got 'em hallucinating
drop the heaviest rhymes known 'til every minds blown
keep it popping until i'm clocking in every time zone
uhh time is money my grind is hungry
it's for my dudes and my dime honeys i got what ya'll need
dames run up and ask where i've been
nothing get 'em high as a bag of rakim
i'm rare like canadian kush with an opium touch
a fat piece of hash  and dust
i've got it so good i got the whole hood smoking it
coke cookers kill for the flow to cook coke in it
the new form of crack turn fans to fanatics
hip hop heads to addicts fiends hit off that

yeah 
there's a message the song that i'm sing new york city
there's a message the song that i'm sing ghettos world wide
there's a message the song that i'm singing  
it's the evil things that people do
the illegal dreams that we pursue
we don't think that we could lose
ya'll know what my purpose is
i spit verses to lift curses off my dead president worshippers
back where the surface is gangsters and murderers
making money made us merciless
it's the birth of the streets it's over they said
rappers crossover they dead 
i spit my verse with technique 'til they knowing their ledge
first it's too deep then i'm over their head
he too lyrical and too subliminal
everything from spiritual to criminal
it's a message in the bottle open it
it's a lesson in survival cope with it
it don't make sense to die for the root of evil
it get too cerebral when that  is legal
either way it's hell i can't save the world
but i can show them how to save themselves from the
evil things that people do
the illegal dreams that we pursue
we don't think that we could lose 
call it cheese or cream or green or blue
it's the root of evil we done proved
it's supreme from me to you 
i see through the eyes of the prophets king tutankhamuns
and martin's and malcolm's elijah muhammad's
wise and with knowledge
paid in full ain't just the size of the pockets
it's rise where the top is rise economics
i'll show you that time
is more valuable then them diamonds in your watches
you grind where the block is you die for them dollars
what's worth more to you your life or your gwop is
thugs is pitching chicks is in the club stripping
flipping drugs or pimping hood is blood or cripping
latin kings and black gorillas
government sits back hoping either that or crack will kill us
it sound like a setup and we the victims
one out of a million will beat the system
getting rich from flipping bricks is over with
take your chips and go legit from the
evil things that people do
the illegal dreams that we pursue
we don't think that we could lose 
call it cheese or cream or green or blue
it's the root of evil we done proved
it's supreme from me to you 
to my g's on the block that do what they gotta do
don't get me wrong i don't judge i'm not knocking you
guess that's what not having a job will do
people starving gotta get they dollars too
get that gwop at night it's a lot of strife
my advice is don't get blinded by the light
drug money and blood money got a price
six feet under or 25 to life
do a crime and you might do the time you serving
what's it worth when you do a crime and get murdered
time is precious time we earned it
time to question your grind is it worth it
it's time that we change the game
we been waiting for change and it came big up obama
why play with death play it safe
do your best to stay away from the
evil things that people do
the illegal dreams that we pursue
we don't think that we could lose 
call it cheese or cream or green or blue
it's the root of evil we done proved
it's supreme from me to you
evil things that people do
the illegal dreams that we pursue
we don't think that we could lose 
call it cheese or cream or green or blue
it's the root of evil we done proved

i love to keep it pushing like the bass and speakers
love hearing real hip hop and making heaters
born entertainer armed with the flamer
if they bust shots when they come on its a banger
the place will lose it  shaking to it
true gangster music screw face included
macho lingo the beat will remind you
of the quatro cinco or cinco de mayo
put it in your car turn the sound sky high
drive down the block sound like a driveby
keep chicks moving heat keep them open
put them in the mood and they leave something broken
dj set the scene true it in the club soundtrack for the hood
 music from a thug
i told you i'm still in love baby
beat drop heavy every rhyme one ton
streets not ready hurry nine one one
spot get frantic too late to panic
 y'all they can't stop from hitting the planet
inside a nigga moral saddam and osama the horror
without the bomb and 
spitting at a show performing vocals are swarming
flow for flow like it's globalwarming
i flood the market out i'm over your head now
roll the carpet out the drought's over and dead now
when i kill a track the true stories
the cause of euphoria the thriller's back
next flow level hip hop lover
dress code ghetto 
just an artist trying to rep the hardest
and make history so not even death could part us it's love
i'm still in love baby still in love
it's the god rakim they know i get it in
they pull me back in i'm going back in
spitting fire ghetto music
getting higher like the drug therapeutic
hooked like an addict strung like sex
look i gotta have it it alleviates stress
quick as marijuana settle in the brain
needle hit the record like heroin the vein
blood start flowing adrenaline rush
love start jonesing school yard crush
ra still fiending still mc'ing
raw deals and g'ing broods still 
it's that dude yeah it's that sick
spit that too talk that shhhh
and wait 'til the lights go off the show start
that's when it's time for ra to go off
you and me you and me
we used to be together used to be
everyday together everyday
always always
you was there from the beginning all i had to do was to vibe
in a race against millions where the loser die
no rules apply but you was my safe haven
at the end of the race waiting so i used your guide
i found heaven in you you shared your life with me
gave me insight way before the light hit me
it's more than just a bond 'cause we inseparable
even when they cut the cord on the umbilical
never more than a moment away
you fixed whatever was wrong and always know what to say
the same way to my sisters and brothers
always honest and showed me what unconditional love is
the voice of a goddess and stars twinkle in your eyes
my heaven on earth or an angel in disguise
if you was here i'd just hug and kiss you
cause a million word can't explain how much i miss you
you and me
we used to be together
everyday together
always
i watched the lady shine and stay on the grind
while the world weighed heavy on a ladies mind
it was a crazy time
it's like the world stopped fast when pops passed in '89
harder we cried the harder you cried too
my father kept your blue skies blue
it's hard to keep going the harder you try too
at january 18th part of you died too
you tried to be stronger keep the fam together
you said we had to keep on and plan for better
while you smile with your open arms
it took awhile to dietect your broken heart
you said it takes some time take it slow
but time will take it's toll and the stakes is high 'til the day you die
but i refused to accept eventually that i would have to say goodbye
you and me we used to be together
everyday together always
i really feel that i'm losing my best friend
i can't believe this could be the end
i'm starting to see how short life is
every second it get shorter but your heart get warmer
and you get stronger even when they said you need a transplant
and dialysis to live longer
it put us in fear put us in tears
you still managed to live life to the fullest for years
then things got complicated they found a donut so they operated
a gift and a curse it's a risk will it work
and concerned then things took a turn for the worse
and even if i'd seen the signs i doubt the actions
nothing could prepare me for what was 'bout to happen
in the hospital the 18th floor vivid
july 18th 2005 i can't forget it
since that day i'm forever numb
the end the day i hoped would never come
you and me we used to be together
everyday together always
i really feel that i'm losing my best friend

big niggas spittin' noise pick that up or lift that up
raised by gangstas and gamblers hustlers con artists
and convicts killers and dons
drug dealers playas and pimps smooth talkers
stick up kids thugs real niggas and gods
haunted by every soul that lay dead in the turf
cursed by every spirit that never made it to birth
since the moon separated from earth

shame on some can't wait til the fame is done
you can curse if you pray for the day to come
stay with the gun stay in the slum stay number 1
to the day the earth drift away from the sun
i meditate and let the ancient spirits speak through the pen
so every word i display a true or a gem or holdin the grim
still shootin two in ya men
if you think the world's greatest can't do it again
4x
there's a cold cold feeling in my heart
yo in the life for thuggin we like to get high from puffin
fortyfive is bustin like live percussion
will them thighs be bobbin
that's why we try to stay alive in hustlin
but some of us die for nothing
try to clock on the block that's horn it with boats on it
with ghetto legends to america's most wanted
lost souls in the crossroads of sidewalk
life is soft when you live and die in new york
you've been wrong before
you'll be missin til your picture's on the wall
on the side of a corner store
either flowin on tour or goin to war
i was born to ball what the fuck is wrong wit y'all
i wrote the scripture
my lyrics just spoken with a flow
there's no vision whole hit in the motion picture
watchin the style you see apocalypse now
and you can feel what i feel when i'm rockin the crowd
from beyond the stars it's the fiend rah
with a god's spoon to bomb my 16 bars
so when they aks why you grievin huh
doin my shit ain't bizar
tell 'em you just seen god
broads is panick cause black jesus is track divas
and packin fiend it's just like heaters causin panick
although i'm organic my rap reaches to where the track
devious speakers ra's off the planet
focus and click i'm unseen so you hope it's a glimpse
foto reflexes of total eclipse
i put the world in a state of a letup
the way i'm puttin in work
yo stay out the way or get hurt
as i mastercrash that allow me to stash the cash
this is the shit they don't have to blast
so grab your glass and your grass and your hash
cause this is just the beginning of the aftermath
no doubt
word
thug baby
take that microphone from that kid and heat it up
i keep the mic hot i heat it up kid
i keep the mic hot i heat it up x2
mic check y'all
then throw it to the floor
the crowd wanted more so i came in the door
the great rakim papermates to the pen
knowledge is born and the light strikes again
elements burst and gave birth to the first
get the pen from the nurse and hook the mic up first
when it absolutely positively has to be there on time
i deliver a rhyme 
the heckler of hip hop hop to this one
i got more kid they hate to miss one
style got jazz and the crowd's out of control
cause i've got the mic and i've got the soul
new york's own microphone technician
thoughts'll give 'em visions
style'll make you listen
devastates the ear my opponents can't see me
i gave 'em directions but wrote it in graffiti
but they wanna know my mo ease back though
they want the exact flow then study my steelo
sketch the skit but they still can't see what i did
i heat the mic up kid
i keep the mic hot i heat it up kid
i keep the mic hot i heat it up x4
then i explode with a song with a original form
or i'll perform it at high mode they want the code
destroyed the blueprints and documents and hits
crews been um looking for clues ever since
beats start brewing up rhymes is rough
stages and microphones selfdestruct
and when you thought you had the format down pat
you get kicked back to the doormat with that
cause i've got a high tech style with knowhow
select the file watch the crowd go wild
bad beats to bless the females' finesse
points shot stress causing cardiac arrest
mics too hot for you to told in your hands
now they sell 'em with fifteen fans and mic stands
mine still overheats if you touch it you can see what i did
i heat the mic up kid
i keep the mic hot i heat it up kid
i keep the mic hot i heat it up x4
if his opponents'll run a rap tell 'em ease back
i've got a knapsack with hip hop attacks
stacks of artifacts formats in the act
tracks after macs and you can't relax
rakim's equipped with penmanship
left my penmate i could graduate from penn state
i could take any trade and make a high grade
even get extra credit when the rhyme's displayed
as soon as i manifest they cheat off my test
surround my desk and then stress the progress
but they miss the point forget the skit
i'll bust your lip if you rip the script
brother's ain't cool and i'mma smoke up the room
and i've got a crew called the last platoon
figure it out kid problems coming
emcees are running cause i'm the gunman
extremely dangerous i bust rhymes into the crowd
and watch 'em all scream out loud
aw man and then i slam like a batteram
ra got the plan with your favorite jam
i keep the mic hot i heat it up kid
i keep the mic hot i heat it up x4
the last platoon
rakim
you know what i mean
yeah with no further adieu
you know who it is
uh ghettos across the world
yo this is what they want
new york city it's what they need
east coast to west coast it's what it is
across seas worldwide baby
aiyyo we stuck in a time of drought nothin to rhyme to about
ghetto of crime on the grind pull an iron out
industry cryin out major labels buyin out
who put the fire out real hip hop is dyin out
sound like the perfect time for ra to set off the new beginnin
let me finish where nas left off
i went to la to get with dre we tried to bridge the gap and
take night mix it with day i guess it wasn't meant to happen
my move a lotta dudes hope i lose but it's cool baby
bounce like medallions till it's off the chain
and i remain up in the lab till it's engulfed in flames
a new block like times square and forty doo wop
without the gun on my hip i bring the new hop
for scott larock freaky ty l eye biggie smalls and tupac
so where my goons at  stand up we right here
where my thugs at  stand up we right here
and all the ogs  stand up we right here
bounce for yourself homie make yourself be heard
but you don't have to dance play it cool and listen
cause you know what this is we give 'em the business
your crew is number 1 if not best and better
here's a hit the 18th letter
this is hell and hell is where the storm is drugs sellers killed for cornets
death is here to haunt us the president's still in office
the heavens hear the horrors and let us feel what war is
deadly weather spill before us to sever seals upon us
rakim up here begin to fear the end is here your goners
stiff as rigarmortis now let 'em feel the chorus
the god spit i'm still here y'all stick for real performance
record deals and tourin my rep is still enormous
i hit the block or party and mommies be watching pappy
the show get smashed photographed by the paparazzi
my army's on it highly don't bring no drama by me
it's deadly period pointblank slash kamikaze
the alpha and omega no doubt an innovator
in front of your bodega it's the style originator
you doubters and you haters ra bout to end your data
with writer's block i'm off the top without the pen no paper
the archaeologist let y'all acknowledge it
then i start the apocalypse then watch the god demolish it
i heard the news there's a dude they wanna hear from
take it from square one lace up them air ones
then bring the new commandments to the planets
for livin life in the hood and for the music fanatics
it's for dimes and dons and for my love of writing songs
when the club mic is on i'm on my justice cipher hold back
so where my goons at  stand up we right here
where my thugs at  stand up we right here
and all the ogs  stand up we right here
bounce for yourself homie make yourself be heard
but you don't have to dance play it cool and listen
cause you know what this is we give 'em the business
your crew is number 1 if not best and better

aiyo once upon a rhyme but way across the maps and seas
in a time that's hard all we have is dreams
in a place surrounded by casualties
bboys and girls wear caps and jeans
they have to fiend infected by rap's disease
but prepared to die for all of rap's beliefs
they love real hiphop real tracks and mc's
and can't stand cats that like to rap for cheese
it ain't all about the gat to squeeze
vs one's or suv's or even stacks of g's
they love thuggin but still they like to catch a breeze
they love clubbin so they go and crash the scene
where the queens treat their men like kings your majesties
dj's trickery spins the wax with ease
on the dancefloor spinnin on they backs and freeze
where mc's kick rhymes in japanese
so japan
let me see you wave your hand
yo japan
let me see you wave your hand
it's the j to the a to the pan
the r to the a to the kim
nobody shut the whole town down since godzilla
think of the sickest thing you even seen  ra's iller
i brought the drama for yokohama i rock a party
for osaka and hiroshima and nagasaki
   until they hear us over in russia
yo who's that clutchin the mic the club rusher
the man you've been askin for after all
you can't ask for more it's the ambassador
rap's diplomat with japan's welcome mat
rap well over tracks i get welcomed back
it's a honor that i'm the one you'd call to rhyme
so when i write i'ma always keep y'all in mind
and i'ma keep spittin like this all the time
but right now this is the time for y'all to shine
 rock the instrumentals
think i hear one now stop the limo
roll down the window and follow the indo
do i love the way y'all get down man listen
this is the land of the turntable technicians
with a can graffiti artists can make a wall glisten
and rhymes it's a whole new language that y'all spittin
i told my peeps in new york city that y'all ghetto
i told cali to spread the world y'all thorough
from chitown and the dirty south they all shouted
told my rollies down in new orleans that y'all bout it
and peace to nigo you move crowds
to my man with the magic marker futura 2 thou
we all make sure it's new styles to learn
until then  rakim shall return
