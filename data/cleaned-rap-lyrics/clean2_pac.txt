as real as it seems the american dream
ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history of mystery but now i see
the american dream wasn't meant for me
cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause i'm strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promise me emancipation indispute nation
all you gave my people was our patience
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my answer shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a damn thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now i'm sitting here mad cause i'm unemployed
but the government's glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power
panther power
coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then i'll yell out
panther power
my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldn't settle for being a statistic
couldn't survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
cause i'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what i'm asking you
you think you living free don't let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
panter power
panther power
as real as it seems the american dream
ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names

i called dizzy whats up

he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long 'til your beat
and then it hit me damn
i got a battle at 6
with out my microphone
i'm guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
i'm a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasn't no use
i tried to rock it onetwo onetwo
but i couldn't get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got yo what if ya loose
it'd be the first time i lost
but if i beat 'em it'd finally prove that i'm the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets

strictly dope won't get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back ha
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
'cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
let knowledge drop
why should i be forced to play dumb
i know where i came from so i'm going to claim some
but rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
stop think of the past the brothers that die for
sucker to try for never to cry more
tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
he's a fake not a friend
so he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
yo he's a trick so he sold his soul for gold
now i know the reason we must excel
cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
move on be strong with unity
cause that's the only way to build communities
lies are told but yo lives must move on
and never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
yo i'm running so i refuse to stop
get sweated by them sell out cops
and i wink cause i pin the opposition
i'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
so listen up to the flavor i gave you now dropping it
we folks know ballers know no stopping it
dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
i got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm 
for the simple fact that i'm black and educated
proud of who am i and you hated
so all i have tried for this many have die for this
you see it and you hear it and you loving it

aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
suckers suffocate when i hype this because you can write this
you constantly bite this
thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
caught with the dope dose
now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
cause you building a boom force
like what you hearing so your checking with the source
tupac brother with the rhymes to rock on
dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
i'm not conceited but defeated i won't be
as long as there's dope beats i'll never be lonely stop
and let me breathe a minute
aiyyo dizzy what's up put the base back in it
let knowledge drop 
by any means neccessary it's kind of scary
knowledge of the hands of adversaries
makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
i was waiting for a present god gave me a goal
i refuse to be busting like a sucker for i'm fighting like a titan
and run you down like a truck
i'll take a chance i vote for rock can see
not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
knowledge appealed to me
pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
the bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
and knowledge drops
drop that

the box with the big beats and my boys started illin'

a ten minute game and we were the winners
the boys started smackin' talkin' that slack and
till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
tried to say we cheat because he got beat
another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
it's not to understand it's just a day in the life
kick it  it's just a day in the life
2pac

got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
but i was all alone so it wasn't no thing
got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
picked it up the salutations little bit frustrations
who could be disturbin' me on my vacation
speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
now i know what michael meant by leave me alone
so i'm askin' who is it and the answer shocks me
it was the voice of my homeboy roct

we get out the car and can barely stand
cause everywhere i look are screamin' fans
girls on my tip but i really don't sweat 'em
they'll tear my new clothes if your bodygurad'll let 'em
hit backstage with two minutes to spare
just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
we hear the introduction the audience is loud
i stepped out on the stage and then i moved the crowd
winners all over we tried to leave the scene
but there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
pen and paper in my face i couldn't be mean
so i was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
it's not hard to understand it's just a day in the life
kick it  it's a day in the life
kick it kick it kick it

knew i was a genius soon as you seen this
avoid hoe's value don't have to redeem this
teenage terror no room for error
a girl start dissin' and i scare her
risin' like inflation on your favorite station
rap is my forte and my recreation
girls wanna kiss me suckers wanna diss me
my mother didn't want me to be but i'ma emcee
the ladies desire emcees admire
that's why many hate me and call me liar
hoods of the hypetip girls on the illtrip
i'm through rockin' this whack so that's it
i am the high type my style is so right
i lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me i'd playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger
you sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer
huh  reach for my drink and for a second we touch
words are muttered i stutter cause i want you that much
the situation is a nowin cause he's my best friend
but now i'm guilty of fallin for his girlfriend
i know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
i offer passion but he offers security
its like a trap that i'm sinkin into
i wake up sweaty when i'm sleepin cause i'm thinkin of you
then we make eye contact and i can't hold back
i try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
what have i gotten into i feel posessed by you
i have these thoughts at night of undressin you
its kinda obvious blind men might see it
but he doesn't so he keeps on trustin me
leaves me alone wit you while he's on vacation
well how could he leave me with this temptation
now i'm confused cause i'm no casanova
but you keep callin  you're sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
girl you are my one and only
you are my angel and now ya wanna leave me lonely
what did i do  baby did i treat you bad
my heart is broken and now ya make me sad
i remember when this love affair first started
we was so in love and now we are departed
girl i'll buy ya anything ya heart desires
i have to let ya know baby you're my fire
warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
it's your sweet caress that makes rock t strong
just bein with you and seein the two of us
walkin along the beach cause girl you are my peach
so sweet and tender my love i surrender
no need to pretend that you'll want it to end
i'll never let you go you're forever my girl
ya know why  cause girl you are my world
my burnin' heart
totally tongue tied every three seconds i keep watchin you
he's my best friend but i can't help clockin you
how could this be  how could we both love you
now i'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when i'm here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond that's already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you don't matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we can't wait to taste each other
you're my addiction cause i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because you're next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
it's too hard to conceal so i know it's for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so i'm feelin nervous
i wanna tell you how i feel but that wouldn't help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words you're sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldn't hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart
my heart is burnin ya know it's yearin for ya sweet caress
i lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
you know ya love me why must you deny yourself
what i can offer you yet you want somebody else
it's not that  well then girl what could it be
i hope i'm good for you cause baby you're so good for me
many nights i cried and tried to make this work
then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
well i'm sorry baby i have to let you know
you are my life my strength i refuse to let you go
you are so beautiful baby you light up my life
i close my eyes and dream of that you'll become my wife
day in and day out it's you i pray about
don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
i love you cause honey you're like a work of art
you got me on fire  my burnin heart
i lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me i'd playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger

i know this girl and her name is minnie
livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldn't quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
2pac
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block i'm from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin' minnie out with the little social climbin'
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
that's is my memory of minnie the moocher
ray tyson
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin' for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin' somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
ray tyson
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin'
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin'
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin'
she would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
 send corrections to the typist

i try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
i'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
cause i ain't a crook despite how i look
i don't sell llello
they're judging a brother like covers and books
follow me into a flow
i'm sure you know which way to go
i'm hittin 'em out of the dopes
so slip on the slope let's skip on the flow
i'm fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddya know it's off with some clothes
that let's me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when i'm collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack
i rendered up piles of black
the wacker the pack the fatter the smack
i hate it when real nigga bust
they hate when i cuss they threaten to bust
i had enough of the fuss
i bust what i bust and cuss when i must
they gave me a charge for sales
for selling the tales of young black males
yes nigga nigga niggaz
        ay nigga you can't handle that shit

        i tell you what  you guys are not gonna be talking
        all that shit when i come back ok
        we gonna say who the big mouth when i come back
you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin' out worse often when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin' up
getting drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get 'em i'll hit 'em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart you'll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didn't do a thing at all
i'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didn't know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but it's a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame it's a shame because the man's slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldn't find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie don't play that
it's time i let 'em suffer the payback
i'm tryin to avoid physical contact
i can't hold back it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
can't use the phone 
cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
did it before
ain't scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now he's the devils friend
too late to be tellin' him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasn't thinkin' all i heard was the ridicule
i fired my weapon
started steppin' in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin' a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin' for my getaway
coppers said freeze or you'll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldn't see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped

chorus 3
chorus 4
chorus 5
chorus 6
killing us one by one 
in one way or another
american will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one 
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
brothers sisters niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight 
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin' better livin'
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but we're the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me it's all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it don't apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobody's gonna like what i pumpin'
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
i'm fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
there's much more to life than just poverty
this is definitly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika america  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidence
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i don't get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day i'm gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
they're pulling your sleave don't believe 
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i can't explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother that's living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took out king
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
nightmare thats what i am
america's nightmare
i am what you made me
the hate and evil that you gave me
i shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for four hundred plus years
you should be scared 
you should be running
you should be trying to silence me
ha ha 
but you can not escape fate
well it is my turn to come
just as you rose you shall fall
by my hands
amerika you reap what you sow
2pacalypse america's nightmare
ice cube and da lench mob america's nightmare
above the law america's nightmare
paris america's nightmare
public enemy america's nightmare
krsone america's nightmare
mutulu shakur america's nightmare
geronimo pratt america's nightmare

ever since you was a peewee down by my knee with a weewee
we been coochiecoo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasn't
but like the old saying goes
time goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope game my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with ak's
and though i been around clowning with the underground
i'm still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for y'all if my homies call
it's a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
you got fame now you run with no shame
i chose rap tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i don't wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go you're not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
i'll be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother only on his cover
i'd be no different than the others
h to the o to the m to the i to the e
i'm down to the end
cause it's a fall in no time at all
i'm down for y'all when my homies call
word if my homies call
well it's ninety one and i'm livin kinda swell now
but i hear that you're going through some hell pal
but life makin records ain't easy
it ain't what i expected it's hectic it's sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
it's fate it wasn't my choice to make
to be great i'm giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
that's why i wrote this song if you ever need me it's on
no matter who the foe they must fall
brenda's got a baby
i hear brenda's got a baby
well brenda's barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
that's not her problem that's up to brenda's family
well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms
and her dad was a junky puttin death into his arm
it's sad cause i bet brenda doesn't even know
just cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
but oh that's a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didn't really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems to notice any change in her figure
she's 12 years old and she's having a baby
in love with a molester who's sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo

rebel rebel    rebel
rebel rebel
they just can't stand the reign or the occasional pain
from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister  it's time for me to explain that i'm the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i don't give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the critics'll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv
it just don't pay to be a truth tellin mc
they won't be happy till i'm banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
it's from the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel he's a rebel rebel of the underground
now i'm face to face with the devils
cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
so you reap what you sow
so reap the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once mo'
now the fox is in the henhouse creepin up on your daughter
while you sleep i got her sneakin out
tupac ain't nuttin nice
i'll be nuttin how i wanna and doin what i'm gonna
now i'm up to no good
the mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
so sit and slip into the sound
peep the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel he's a rebel rebel of the underground
they say they hate me they wanna hold me down
i guess they scared of the rebel  the rebel of the underground
but i never let it get me
i just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
in fact they tryin to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they don't like what i'm talkin bout
so what's wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
but me i'm comin from the soul
and if it don't go gold my story still gettin told
and that way they can't stop me
and if it sells a couple of copies the punks'll try to copy
it's sloppy don't even try to
i'm a slave to the rhythm and i'm about to fly through
so yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin street slang but the punks still can't hang
they makin records bout violence 
but when it comes to the real some brothers go silent
it kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out just to get your record out
but 2pacalpyse is straight down
so feel the wrath of the rebel  the rebel of the underground

i love it when they fear me 

 holla if ya hear me
 you're too near me to see it clearly

 holla if ya hear me

pac's theme
statements variously said throughout song 
i was raised in this society so there's no way
you can expect me to be a perfect person cuz i'm a do what i'm a do
i am still thirsty  arrested development

i thought i hit rock bottom they ban my album point the finga
i guess nobody loves a real niggaslashrap singer
i thought i'd bring a little truth to the young troops
i brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
it's not to be a racist but let's face this
wouldn't you if we could trade places
i got lynched by some crooked cops and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
but when i get my check they takin tax out
so we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
ain't that a bitch some officers are gettin rich
whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
as far as jealousy bein a celebrity
no matter who committed the crime they all yell at me
and the media is greedier than most
you could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
and everyday i read the paper there's another lie
they show my picture for the crimes of another guy
now how's that for the life of a big shot
a dead cop a law suit a little kid shot
i play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for tryin to earn they stripes in the dark
just cause i come there don't mean i from there peep
only jealous motherfuckers beef and point the finga
 
boom boom boom on your black ass bitch
as i run up on em madman a nutcase with a screw loose
a zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies

the pen niggas

i give a holler to my sisters on welfare
tupac cares if don't nobody else care
and uhh i know they like to beat ya down a lot
when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please don't cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but don't forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
and if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
cause sister you don't need him
and i ain't tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy what's that
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think it's time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we don't we'll have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man can't make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know you're fed up ladies but keep your head up
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how i'd rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
i'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
it's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems i'm headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but they're blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
it's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rain'll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know it's funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but can't feed the poor
say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
it ain't no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we ain't meant to survive cause it's a setup
and even though you're fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact i'm sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
you can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because there's too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside you're looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things don't all down this week
cause if it did you couldn't take it and don't blame me
i was given this world i didn't make it
and now my son's getting older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
i'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and it's crazy it seems it'll never let up but
yo law
is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one
yeah  mr fuckacop is back
and i still don't give a fuck ya know what i'm sayin
puffin on this indo in the studio with my partners out here
pacific heights in the house know what i mean
   
i was framed so don't make the same mistake nigga
you gotta learn how to shake the snakes nigga
cause the police love to break a nigga
send em upstate cause they straightup hate the niggaz
so what i do is get a crew of zoo niggaz
straight fools into rules and do niggaz
and onetime had enough of me
i'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
they wanna send me to the pen punk picture that
i stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
it ain't easy bein me i can't take it
life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
and ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
if they can't screw me they find a way to sue me
now can you picture me coolin at a night club
nothin but love but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
since i wear a lot of gold they plot
don't know what i got and get shot with the hot ones
and aww yeah i wanna feel guilty
but you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
you'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
it's beepin while i cut you with my razor
i'm not violent i'm petrified and nervous
i got no mercy for these niggaz tryin to serve us
but if you catch me outta pocket then i'm got
you love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
now drop it
   
chorus 2pac
strictly for my  strictly for my  strictly for my niggaz
strictly for my niggaz makin g's
reflected and disrespected plus i'm rejected
you're just another rapper who swears he's makin records
that's what they said  whenever i would walk by
i never tripped though  always kept my head up high
eventually i knew that i would find my way
after the darkest night always comes a brighter day
and some would say that turned away is all you'll get
cause in the end i knew that i would have it all
while nonbelievers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart i'm knowin that they wish me hell
yo get a real job rappin doesn't pay the rent
i hate the studio cause that's where all my money went
never surrender it's all about the faith you've got
don't ever stop just push it til you hit the top
and if you drop at least you know you gave your all
be true to you and that way you can never fall
but beware these backstabbers ain't no joke
just like a rope they hang on you until you're broke
and when you're broke they move onto the next dope
and there you are can't even pay your car nope
and when you reminisce thinkin how you got dissed
remember how it felt and then remember this
be true to you believe that there's no one bigger
cause they can all suck dick  it's strictly for my niggaz
chorus
this is this is for the critics if you live up
pick up my shit or i'll be back doin stickups
i better see five stars next to my picture
if not tupac will cop the glock and come knockin to getcha
i told you once motherfucker i'm a nut
play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin when you're fucked
niggaz know what's up but they be tryin to hold me down
i'm comin outta oaktown bitch fuck around
and it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
nigga it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
and to the marks that be talkin all that shit
screamin out the next nigga's name like a bitch
and the niggaz that i ran into recently
the motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
you little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin trigga
now you live in fear of a heartlessass nigga
mr troublesome niggaz tried to play me with the gat
but like terminator nigga i'll be back
yeah  and i'll be back with a fuckin army

cause most motherfuckers love to act up
without they backup when they get jacked up they crack up
it's strictly for my niggaz at the show
so they know not to play me like a ho ho
strictly for my
growing up as an inner city brotha
where every other had a pops and a motha
i was tha product of a heated lover
nobody knew how deep it screwed me
and since my pops never knew me
my family didn't know what ta do with me
was i somebody they despise
curious look in they eyes
as if they wonder if i'm dead or alive
poor momma can't control me
quit tryin' ta save my soul i wanna roll with my homies
a ticken timebomb
can't nobody fade me
packin' a 380
and fiendin' for my mercedes
suckers scatter

i hope i live to be a man
must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
penn
counting pennys over tha years
i'd done stacked many
proven wrong those

amongst tha babies who raised up from tha slavery
i sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
moved out west and i invest in all tha best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
put ta rest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family

had to play catch by myself what a sorry sight
a pitiful plight so i pray for a starry night
please send me a pops before puberty
the things i wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
moms always work i barely see her
i'm startin to get worried without a pops i'll grow to be her
it's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when i pray i pray i'll never grow to be that way
and i hope that he answers me
i heard god don't like ugly well take a look at my family
a different father every weekend
before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
i'm gettin sick of all the friendships
as soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
how can i be a man if there's no role model
strivin to save my soul i stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
i'm so sorry
   
chorus
i'm so sorry

i'm gettin a bit older and i'm startin to be a bother
moms can't stand me cause i'm lookin like my father
should i stay or run away tell me the answer
moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
instead of takin care of me he'd rather live lavishly
that's why i'll never be a father
unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
that's when i started hatin the phony smiles
 said i was an only child
look at mama's lonely smile
it's hard for a son to see his mother cry
she only loves you but has to fuck with these other guys
i'm so sorry
chorus
i'm so sorry
for all this time
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time so sorry
for all this time so sorry baby

but from the cradle to the grave i'ma put in work
from the cradle to the grave
life ain't never been easy livin in the ghetto
from the cradle to the grave
life ain't never been easy livin in the ghetto
time's movin fast will i last another day
so i pray and i lay with my ak
did i sell my soul as a young kid
all the things i did wishin someone held me but they never did
i can't take it will i make it to my older age
before i'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin cage
lord help me guide me save me
cause that's the way that daddy raised me crazy
do or die nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck
you'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
nobody cares it's me against the world
keepin murder on my mind and my tec 9
i got nothin to lose payin dues nigga you wanna die
i get high and then my mission is a walkby
you'd better jet when i hit your set cause i'm comin
one in the chamber for the anger that i build inside
for the mothers that cried for my homies that died
the beginning is an ending am i just a slave
so i got to be brave from the cradle to the grave
from the cradle to the grave
life ain't never been easy livin in the ghetto
from the cradle to the grave
life ain't never been easy livin in the ghetto
i would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks
but no
tupac
i'm up before the sunrise first to hit the block
little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks
and i'm totin' these thangs get my skinny little ass kicked
and niggas laugh til' tha first mothafucka got blasted
i put the nigga in his casket
now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
i smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts 
i'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce
and gettin' lost on the fiveo fuck them hos
got a 45 screamin' about survival
hey nigga can i lay low cook some yayyo
don't want to go to the pen i'm hittin' fences
narcs on a nigga's back missin' me by inches
and they say how do you survive weighin' 165
in a city where the skinny niggas die
tell mama don't cry
even when they kill me
they can never take the game from a young g
i'm still ballin'
still ballin'
still on parole and i'm the first nigga servin'
pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it
but if i want to make a million gotta stay dealin'
it's kinda boomin' and today i'll make a killin'
dressin' down like a villian' but only on the block
it's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops
ha i'm gettin' high i think i'll die if i don't get no ends
i'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a benz
i hate to stip let my music bump
drinkin' liquor and i'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck
rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
as i slang another ounce i wish it was a kilo
a need money in a major way
time to fuck my beeeyatch hey and getting paid
you other mothafuckas callin'
but me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas
we straight ballin'
straight ballin'
damned if i don't and damned if a nigga do
so watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to raise up
but don't let them see you cry dry your eyes
young nigga time to do or die
i keep a pistol in my pocket
ready on my block
ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
and now they see that mothafucka beat pain
at point blank range cause he slept on the game
ain't a damned thing changed
shakin' the dice now roll 'em
if you can't stand pain better hold 'em
cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll
you might go catch aids from a slight cold  nigga
better live your life to the fullest
you 'bout to kill a fool got a pistol mothafucka better pull it
cause even when they kill me 
they can never take the game from a young g
we straight ballin'
to my niggas in the penitentiary
loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me
cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born
and once again it's on 
i'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone
who the hell can you get to stop me
i'm in the projects parlaying with my posse
i keep my glock cocked
i need it cause they're all shady
i finally made it 
now these jealous bitches tryin' to fade me
i ain't goin' out i'd rather blast back
i'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack
and i came up a long way from food stamps
and takin' shit from the lowlife ghetto tramps
could you blame me if they sweat me i'm gonna open fire
what could i do  pull my trigga or watch my nigga die
i'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs
i'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs
and mothafucka we be ballin'
all mothafuckin' day long stay strong
we straight ballin'
a coward dies a thousand deaths
a soldier dies but once
they say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
picturin pitiful punk niggaz coppin pleas
puffin weed as i position myself to clock g's
my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
evadin the playa hatin tricks while hittin switches
bitches is badmouth cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
but y'all some hoes the game should be sewed
i'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
i run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
i'm duckin the cop i hit the weed as i'm clutchin my glock
niggaz is hot when i hit the block what if i die tonight
if i die tonight repeat
polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
when i get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
he got it by killer preoccuppied with bein boss
revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posse's usin deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame
the police know my name a different game ain't a thing changed
i'm seein cemetary photos of my peers
conversatin like they still here if i die tonight
chorus
pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
pray to the heavens threefiftysevens to the sky
and i hope i'm forgiven for thug livin when i die
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto for thug niggaz
a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
overdose of a dick while drinkin liquor when i lay her
pistol whippin these simps for bein petrified and lame
disrespectin the game prayin for punishment and pain
goin insane never die live eternal who shall i fear
don't shed a tear for me nigga i ain't happy hear
i hope they bury me and send me to my rest
headlines readin murdered to death my last breath
take a look picture a crook on his last stand
motherfuckers don't understand if i die tonight
it's just me against the world
oooohhh oooohhh
nuttin to lose
it's just me against the world baby
oahhhh oahhhahh
i got nuttin to lose
it's just me against the world
ohhahhh
stuck in the game
me against the world baby
can you picture my prophecy
stress in the city the cops is hot for me
the projects is full of bullets the bodies is droppin
there ain't no stoppin me
constantly movin while makin millions
witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
carries to children cause they're illin
addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe he'll listen in his casket  the aftermath
more bodies being buried  i'm losing my homies in a hurry
they're relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my vision's blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
i'm headed for danger don't trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever i'm feelin this anger
don't wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
what's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
it's just me against the world baby
me against the world
it's just me against the world
ooooh yeah ooohooo
it's just me against the world
me against the world
cause it's just me against the world baby
hey
me against the world
ooooh yeah
i got nuttin to lose
it's just me against the world baby
i got nothing to lose
could somebody help me  i'm out here all by myself
see ladies in stores baby capone's livin wealthy 
pictures of my birth on this earth is what i'm dreamin
seein daddy's semen full of crooked demons already crazy
and screamin i guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared but left me prepared for a while
is there another route  for a crooked outlaw
veteran a villian a young thug who one day shall fall
everday there's mo' death and plus i'm doughless
i'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
cause ain't no bucks to stack up my nuts is backed up
i'm bout to act up go load the mac up now watch me klacka
tried makin fat cuts but yo it ain't workin
and evil's lurking i can see him smirking
when i gets to pervin so what
go put some work in and make my mail makin sales
risking 25 with a l but oh well
me against the world
with nuttin to lose
it's just me against the world
ooh yeah ooohooooh

i got nuttin to lose
it's just me against the world baby
hahahh hehe heyy
with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finaly get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
don't settle for less  even the genius askses questions
be grateful for blessings
don't ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best don't let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things don't go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they don't wanna listen
if i'm insane it's the fame made a brother change
it wasn't nuttin like the game
it's just me against the world
me against the world
nuttin to lose
it's just me against the world baby
me against the world
got me stuck in the game
it's just me against the world
oahahhhh
i'd be ashamed to lose
it's just me against the world baby
me against the world
outro 2pac

i know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
remember one thing
through every dark night there's a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it
i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears if i should die before i wake
please god walk with me grab a nigga and take me to heaven
back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me i'm not livin in the past you wanna last
be tha first to blast remember kato

now rest in peace

so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that i'm strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause i'm cursed i'm havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again i'm goin blind
i spend my time in this cell ain't livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die 
baptized in eternal fire i'll shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now i'm lost and i'm weary so many tears
i'm suicidal so don't stand near me
my every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
to embrace an early death now there's nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldn't rest
i'm barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldn't see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the mo'nin to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years god and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
brokenhearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this ain't the life for me i wanna change
but ain't no future right for me i'm stuck in the game
i'm trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately i've been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
i'm hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys can't take no more
i'm fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heaven's door  shed so many tears

with that jealousy they need to miss me don't sweat me
if them cowards really want me come get me and even i
someday will die but i'm cautious i'm fin' to ride
put down the top now we flossin
hit the freeway let the wind blow drop the window
workin with a twenty sack of indo feelin good
stop through the hood grab the young thugs
and i can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs know it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends

when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face
ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddy's the same drama
when things went wrong we'd blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and who'd think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police that's right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama
i finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed
a poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
there's no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
lady 
don't cha know we love ya  sweet lady
        dear mama
place no one above ya sweet lady
        you are appreciated
don't cha know we love ya
now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
he passed away and i didn't cry cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i ain't guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rent's due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
you're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough you're alone
you're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
pour out some liquor and i reminsce cause through the drama
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that i'm hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
it's a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
sweet lady
        and dear mama
        dear mama
lady 
keepin it real
i take a shot of henessey now i'm strong enough to face the madness
nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
phone calls from my niggaz on the other side
two childhood friends just died i couldn't cry
a damn shame when will we ever change
and what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
arguements with my boo is true
i spend mo' time with my niggaz than i do with you
but everywhere it's the same thang that's the game
i'll be damned if a thang changed fuck the fame
i'll be hustling to make a million lord knows
ain't no love for us ghetto children so we cold
rag top slowin down time to stop for gas
beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass uhh
it ain't easy that's my motto
drinkin tanqueray straight out the bottle
everybody wanna know if i'm insane
my baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
and all the drama got me stressin like i'm hopeless i can't cope
me and the homies smokin roaches cause we broke
late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high
watchin the cops roll by
it ain't easy that's right
chorus 2pac
it ain't easy being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free
i can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while i'm dreamin
wake up sweaty and screamin cause i can hear them suckers schemin
probably paranoid problem is them punks be fantasizin
a brother bite the bullet open fire and i died
i wonder why this the way it is even now
lookin out for these killer kids cause they wild
bill clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
doin twenty to life in san quentin
gettin calls from my nigga mike tyson ain't nuttin nice
yo 'pac do something righteous witcha life
and even thou you innocent you still a nigga so they figure
rather have you behind bars than triggers
but i'm hold ya down and holla thug life lickin shots
til i see my niggaz free on the block
but no it ain't easy hahahah
til i see my niggaz free on the block oh

chorus 275

of hearin screams at my concerts me all my childhood peers
through the years tryin to stack a little green
i was only seventeen when i started servin fiends
and i wish there was another way to stack a dollar
so my apoli' casue these hard times make me wanna holler

cause muhfuckers think i'm buggin so now i'm in
this high powered cell at the county jail
punk judge got a grudge can't post no bail what

gettin battered and bruised by the you know who
and these fakes get to shakin when they face me
snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
sittin in this livin hell listenin to niggaz yell
tryin to torture em to tell i'm gettin mail

they violated my probation and it seems
i'll be goin on a long vacation meanwhile
it ain't easy

chorus

it's like your man don't understand all he does is stress ya
i can see your state of misery from the introduction
ain't bout no suckin and touchin just harmless discussion
maybe we can see a better way find a brighter day
late night phone conversations  would that be ok
i don't wanna take up all your time be the next in line
tell me your size let me find you things with you in mind
i can see you're cautious and i'm careful not to scare you
but anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when i'm standin near you
news of precision will prepare ya
in case you get scared just ask the man in the mirror
now the picture's getting clearer all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in god
i don't understand i just wanna bring ya home
i wonder should i leave you alone and find a woman of my own
all the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
i contemplate  but in my heart i know you worth it
tell me can you get away
ebony can you get away
c'mon let's go can you get away

could it be my destiny to be lonely
and checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
but you was different  i got no need to be suspicious
cause i can tell  my life with you would be delicious
the way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
i'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
even though i got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
you blow me kisses
when he ain't lookin now your heart's tooken
my only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
wanna take you there but you scared to follow come see tomorrow
hoping i can take you through the pain and sorrow
let you know i care  that someone's there for your struggle
depend on me when you have needs or there's trouble
i wanna give you happiness and maybe even more

all you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
i thought we was cool i was a fool thinkin you could be true
when i don't fuck with your punk crew

i went from hell to livin well
bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain

chorus
chorus  2pac speaks over it
aiyyo how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be

a bitch can be like fifteen fuckin with a nigga 35

hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
when these niggaz get to trickin hahaha it's over then
that's aight though
keep a nigga heavy in the game bout so long
watch them hoes
all you niggaz out there
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those 
who can withstand the mo' power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate it's been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard i'm faced with it i'm a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
i'm soon to count the bodies
so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that asss shakin
i'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
who's in control i'm acvtivatin yo souls
you know the way the games get controlled
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat
chorus method man
i got my mind made up come on 
get in get in too 
let it ride  tonight's tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonight's tha night
well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac won't collapse
cause nowaday's shit's evading the xrays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
i'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed that's before it's ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
there's no escape nah i ain't blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mc's i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under seige and i'm jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
i'm out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message don't touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket  blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clan's three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when i'm splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch don't get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs can't fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
with this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
i'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly 
and i'm out for nine nickel 
chorus kci and jojo

intro 2pac
only god can judge me is that right
 only god can judge me now
only god baby nobody else nobody else

perhaps i was blind to the facts stabbed in the back
i couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
will i succeed paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus try to focus but i can't see
and in my mind i'ma blind man doin time
look to my future cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine
everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
i've been trapped since birth cautious cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but it's my own kind doin all the killin here
i can't lie ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside make em wish i died
oh my lord tell me what i'm livin for
everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
and all my memories of seein brothers bleed
and everybody grieves but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
cause the media is full of dirty tricks
only god can judge me
chorus 2pac
 only god can judge me

screamin i can make it 
got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked 
still i can't breathe somethings evil in my iv
cause everytime i breathe i think they killin me 
i'm having nightmares homicidal fantansies 
i wake up stranglin danglin my bed sheets
i call the nurse cause it hurts to reminisce
how did it come to this  i wish they didn't miss 
somebody help me tell me where to go from here
cause even thugs cry but do the lord care 
try to remember but it hurts
i'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the dirt
i'd rather die like a man than live like a coward 
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours black power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state 
and our fate is a lifetime of hate 
dear mama can you save me  and fuck peace
cause the streets got our babies we gotta eat
no more hesitation each and every black male's trapped 
and they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped 
mista police please try to see that it's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me
only god can judge me
chorus w variations
interlude 2pac
that which does not kill me can only make me stronger
        that's for real 
and i don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
        you know
let me live baby let me live
pac i feel ya keep servin it on the reala
for instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
would you be wrong for buckin a nigga to the pavement
he gon' get me first if i don't get him fool start prayin
ain't no such thing as selfdefense in the court of law
so judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross that's real
got him lurked him crept the fuck up on him
sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
after talkin behind my back like a bitch would
it be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe knowin you on that paper chase 
grass glass big screen and leather couch
my new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce

them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the bay
pac when you was locked down that's when i'll be around
start climbing up the charts so sick but they tried to clown 
that's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies

chorus w variations

and fear of man  grow on trees

so niggaz whisper when they mention 
machiavelli was my tutor donald goines my father figure
moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers

congratulations on the weddin i hope your wife know
she got a player for life and that's no bullshitin
i know we grew apart you probably don't remember

whole neighborhood buzzin knowin that we wasn't
used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
i'm gettin blitzed and i reminsce on all the times we shared
besides bumpin n grindin wasn't nothin on our mind
in time we learned to live a life of crime
rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
i caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
and even though we seperated you said that you'd wait
don't give nobody no coochie while i be locked up state

that i keep a glock beside my head when will it stop

i got shot up i surprised tha niggas tha way i got up
and then
i hit the studio
it's time to blow tha block up
no hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
it's a celebration 
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
i want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
will i be great is it my fate 
to live tha life of luxury
some niggas bought my tapes

so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isn't fair fair
probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure fuck with me
i give that ass a try
nigga holla at me
chorus
                   
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay
ohhhhhh

criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
secrets in tha dark
only her and i know
now i'm sitten' in tha state pen
doin time for slow 
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin' 
just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin'
cause 
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
a cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me on top of me
i'm runnin' from tha coppers
but never let'em stop me
cause i'm a soulja 
hell ever since i was a little nigga havin' fantasies
of one day getting older
niggas is paranoid
trust
a no no
love is a mystery

baby you're moving to fast
my conversations are getting deeper but first let me ask 
are you afraid of a thug  
and have you ever made love 
with candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
touch me and let me activate your bloodpressure

help the average man love better

take a shot of that alazhay 
come give me a kiss
and maybe we can be better friends 
perhaps we'll be closer
i'll be the thug in your life

in today's music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at tupac
excuse me makaveli's verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release
the question everbody wants to know is  
why'd they get this nigga started
tupac rather makaveli was not available for comment
but released this statement
it's not about east or west

and i remember what my papa told me
remember what my papa told me blasphemy
the preacher want me buried why cause i know he a liar
have you ever seen a crackhead that's eternal fire

mama tell me am i wrong is god just another cop
waitin to beat my ass if i don't go pop
memories of a past time givin up cash
to the leaders knowin damn well it ain't gonna feed us

it's hard enough to live now in these times of greed
they say jesus is a kind man well he should understand
times in this crime land my thug nation
do what'chu gotta do but know you gotta change
try to find a way to make it out the game
i leave this and hope god can see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door  i leave this here
i leave this and hope god see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door  and my people say
our father who art in heaven
hallow be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done
in earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
as we give up our debts
as we forgive our debtors
lead us not into temptation
but deliver us unevil
for god is the kingdom and the power
in the life we live as thugs
everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
it's hard to be a man
ridin wit my gun in hand
why explain the game niggaz ain't listenin

itchin givin suckas plenty space
have these bitch niggaz snitchin
where are we now guns found daily the feds surely hope
that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
they backwards make tracks burst whenever i rap
attack words bein known to explode on contact
extreme at times blinded by my passion and fury
look at me laugh at my competition flashin my jewelry
you'd stay silent if you niggaz knew me truly effective
the shit you heard ain't do me justice  got a death wish bitch
run up face me and trace wit an infared beam
it seems niggaz ain't recognize my team
ain't nobody holdin you back explode the track to confetti
unload it cause niggaz ain't ready  the life of an outlaw
code three attack formation pull out your pistols
keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin to get you
merciless madman screamin kamikaze in tongue
automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run
who should i call when i'm shot and bleedin
indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
dope got me hatin fiends scheme with my team just a chosen few
my foes victim of explosives come closer exhale the fumes
we got memories fadin fast a slave for cash
accelerate mash blast then dash

niggaz ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws  never surrender
death is for a son to stay free i'm thugged out

scarred but still breathin believe in me and you could see the victory
a warrior with jewels can you picture me life of an outlaw

caught up in this world i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them precious boys and girls
born black in this white man's world  and all i heard was
who knows what tomorrow brings
in this world where everyone's blind
and where to go no matter how far i'll find
to let you know that you're not alone
only thing they ever did wrong yes yes
was bein born black in this white man's world no doubt
  all my ghetto motherfuckers be proud to be black and be proud
all my little black seeds born black in this white man's world
  to have this shit like this cause ain't nobody got it like this
  all these motherfuckers wanna be like us they all wanna be like us
  to be the havenots all hail
  god bless the child that can hold his own no motherfuckin doubt

my adversaries shipped in caskets murdered them bastards
witness the past got bombastic
now that they freed me no one can see me
i completely eradicated my competition father forgive them

you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those 
who can withstand the mo' power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate it's been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard i'm faced with it i'm a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
i'm soon to count the bodies
so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that asss shakin
i'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
who's in control i'm acvtivatin yo souls
you know the way the games get controlled
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat
chorus method man
i got my mind made up come on 
get in get in too 
let it ride  tonight's tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonight's tha night
well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac won't collapse
cause nowaday's shit's evading the xrays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
i'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed that's before it's ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
there's no escape nah i ain't blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mc's i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under seige and i'm jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
i'm out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message don't touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket  blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clan's three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when i'm splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch don't get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs can't fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
with this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
i'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly 
and i'm out for nine nickel 
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support

sparkle like live but harder than tarvue
wreck this rhyme start relentless roughest
and fuck up the party for you paying muthafuckas

e40 a motherfucker's gonna get his marlboros regardless playa
tupac you supposed to
 send corrections to the typist
sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me heartbroken fine so many babies screamin'
cuz they seein destruction before they see a human bein
so they start smoking we will never get our day
until we learn to pray keep our families in shake
cuz they all broken why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly somebody else should try 
cocking guns smoking we can all make a change
so i'm told but i haven't seen a change unfold
i'll keep hopin please if you prefer to breathe
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open i can only say i'll try
until the day i die i promise to be wise
with my heart open greed brings only misery
away the tragedy so i stay sucker free
only a few chosen rise my ghetto queens rise
don't be afraid to try too many of us die
before they daughter open wise my brother's speak wise
stay focused on the prize though everybody dies
we can only learn to take our anger and our hate
control our mental stakes settle down and set it straight
maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
before we said it regret it later and let it escalate 
cuz by then its just too late there's so much we can take
and there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
to the point that he just brakes snaps and its all it takes
you think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
but we ain't its plain to go against 
with every artist comes the image he portrays and the picture that he paints
but in the mist of all this anger and this angst 
never once did you heard me say i'm a gangster and i ain't hear any complaints
but i know that i will always continue to grow
as long as i lead and never follow no one else's shadow
there will never be another me and that i can guarantee 
that's why the fuck i remain sucker free
to this day the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame and success they attain
there will never be another me 
and no matter what they do there will never be another you
you can search but you'll never find
you can try to rewind time but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die we are forever alive
and we continue growin one day at a time
don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money ya like
seachin for fortune and fame and superstardom
all the jury all the calls who grouse is harder
there's not a hiphop police the villains is watchin
and the kids think beef is they only option
outlawz born filthy guilty as charged
my memories took a die my macaveli lives on
you think the industry is fun and no pity with guns
and when your money is up that's when your enemies come
so if he die and came back would he try to save rap
we needing a change the drama remains  the same
i spend my whole life yeah fightin myself
that i can't win so i'm invitin some help
and hey now then i take rights and no lefts
i'm still just like a kid lookin for stripes on my belt
yeah that there is a fight in itself
so i just pray and hope god take a light to myself
no matter how much i try stay alive i'm a die a man
still standin there in love my pride
my heart  we passed that
i'm tryin to keep  keep comin and collect all my ass cap
the rappers in the game ain't change
and i finally realize that we not in the same game
the hatin' will never end so i guess i'll deal with it
them 45's will pop killa's yes i'm still with it
the streets is military you gotta be a soldier
gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
they do what they gotta do to shock them and hold us
so we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin
one way at a time keep the faith in your mind
and we continue growin one day at a time
 send corrections to the typist
black cotton
black cotton  a symbol for unrewarded struggle
time for a little gospel tail
ghetto gospel that is listen
robbin' black cotton in god's eyes
speak
black cotton
steady stressin' smith and wessons count my blessin's
class is in session the worst question is the first question

never got paid but still we slave in the nine tre
answer that then answer this too
loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true

fat track got ya sprung now your hung do ya feel me
dum dum diddy is it me
attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
if not peace then at least let's get a piece
i'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets deceased
lookin' through my highschool yearbook
reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
one homie two homie three homies  poof
we used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
god come save the misbegotten
lost ghetto souls of black cotton in god's eyes
nobody don't care
no matter how hard i try look to the sky
nobody don't care
seems like my dreams drowned in by screams no answer to my questions
nobody don't care
feels like i'm pressed why do i stress it's like i'm being tested
nobody don't care
seems like my prayers vanish to thin air please answer my questions
nobody don't care
in the belly of the beast i'm bubbling up
running out of luck about to self destruct
old heads say live your life like such
your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
i wouldn't listen to 'em
your power movement was cool
but it ain't fix nothin'
so i just go with what i know
i don't trust none
look what the 80's did
to what's bebe's kids
and now we grown up
nobody ain't own us yet
black cotton i'm plottin' 
i'm workin' without a profit
they shacklin' all my homies
i'm hurtin' but keep the mind

certainly we survive with outlaw ridas
what's the reward for a strugala
if the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
runnin up gun cocked like nasty gloves
if you ain't got a penny mind the glove
no love
waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
black cotton  i'm hoppin' over enemy lines
black cotton  i ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
black cotton
nobody don't care
no matter how hard i try look to the sky
nobody don't care
seems like my dreams drowned in by screams no answer to my questions
nobody don't care
feels like i'm pressed why do i stress it's like i'm being tested
nobody don't care
seems like my prayers vanish to thin air please answer my questions
so what i'm gonna do hopefully is i wanna be
i don't wanna be i am tupac shakur

korean motherfuckers was crooked
so niggaz had to burn and loot 'em
now the streets ain't safe at night my niggaz
 uhh straight take his life
so don't sleep when my team creep up how we hit 'em
empty the clip then dip cause we did 'em
lickin off shots for latasha that's proper
love for my niggaz but a glock for the coppers
so what the fuck you wanna do now
i packed a nine last year
in ninetynine i'm packin two now

niggaz is like photographers all they take is headshots

niggaz nowadays they worry me
my bars is therapy as long as you usin 'em thoroughly
muah 'til the day that they bury me
my niggaz is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
and i'm a product of the 70's
the hood got niggaz on punishment that's why they never leave
if i ain't eatin wit'chu i'm probably beefin wit'chu
if no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin wit'chu
i know you got a gun but i'm hopin you keep it wit'chu
cause unfortunately i'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and
know what the llama do shady aftermath
ruff ryders d block and of course amaru
lot of people honor you probably cause the way
that you used to bring the drama to whoever you wanted to

 poems written by shakur as  interpreted by other artists
yes sir
this is ludacris
in a recite to you an original poem written by my man tupac shakur
intitled in the depts of solitude
and it goes with a something like this
eh ehhm
yeah
i exsist in the depths of solitude
ponderin my true goal
tryin to find piece of mine
and still preserve my soul
constantly learnin to be accepted
and from all recieve respect
never comprimising but sometimes risci
and that is my only regret
how can there be peace
a young heart with an old soul
how can i be in the depts of solitude
when there are to inside of me
this duo within me causes the perfect oppotunity
to learn and live twice as fast
as those who accepts simplicity
yes
if you're reading between the lines you can understand exactly what my man
tupac shakur was talking about mayne
you see in or outside the music industry
everyone has heard the expression as lonely on top
well you know
pac was on top
it's only naturally that he exsisted
in the depts of solitude
of course he was a young heart with an old soul
and individual with what was a way ahead of his time
and sometimes when you are ahead of youre time
you do wonder what your true goal in life is
when you get so ovius critisising and put down for teaching
what you've learned to others
and doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do
so with that
pac like all soldiers fought to be accepted
specially by those who rejected him the most
and even if you didn't like him
you had to respect him
see nobodys perfect
and off course everyone makes mistakes
but experience is the best teaching if you ask me
so its important to learn from each mistake
and try hard not to make the same one twice
his only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times
but it was the wild outrages pac
mixed with the sensitive love in pac
that made him almost the perfect person
also made him learn and live twice as fast
and i'm sure he would rather walk through life
with these multived dimentional personalities
than to exept beeing one side than simplistic
anyday
so being in the depts of solitude if you ask me
is were the true heros of our times stay
tupac shakur in our hearts and our minds forever
rest in peace live in harmony
this is luda signing out
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those 
who can withstand the mo' power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate it's been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard i'm faced with it i'm a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
i'm soon to count the bodies
so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that asss shakin
i'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
who's in control i'm acvtivatin yo souls
you know the way the games get controlled
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat
chorus method man
i got my mind made up come on 
get in get in too 
let it ride  tonight's tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonight's tha night
well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac won't collapse
cause nowaday's shit's evading the xrays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
i'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed that's before it's ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
there's no escape nah i ain't blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mc's i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under seige and i'm jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
i'm out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message don't touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket  blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clan's three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when i'm splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch don't get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs can't fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
with this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
i'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly 
and i'm out for nine nickel 
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those
who can withstand the mo' power i gain

choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 colt
and i'm out for nine nickel
i set the mic in flames my name's ins the rebel
murder one style smash piles straight to pebbles
mental terrorist specialist at this
menacing lyricst leave crews defenseless
can't design landmines lick off like nines
to paralyze everything ears ring like doorknobs
heads start to turn like police who pass
hear the blast my crew bust through like tear gas
fuck a mask we laced in place like the marshall
sparkle like live but harder than tarvue
wreck this rhyme start relentless roughest
and fuck up the party for you paying muthafuckas
once i commence for you ladies and gents
i kick rhymes sharper than barbwire fence
the live and direct from killah hill project
staten island new york you can't help but to hawk
lay it on your dental that's if you want it hostile
sounds so underground i write my rhymes on fossil
dudes like this force me to get you open
shit tired of gettin shot at
tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
niggaz need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong that's just for us
niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
you know what i mean  where do niggaz go when we die
ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
that's why we go to thug mansion
that's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a g
 at thug mansion
a place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine i cry at times
i once contemplated suicide and woulda tried
but when i held that 9 all i could see was my momma's eyes
no one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
we found a family spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we g's
we still visualize places that we can roll in peace
and in my mind's eye i see this place the players go in fast
i got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion
  nas
every corner every city
there's a place where life's a little busy
little hennessy laid back and cool
every hour cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright i wanna go
nothin but peace i wanna go love i wanna go nigga
and street passion every ghetto needs a thug mansion
a place where death doesn't reside just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees no cops rollin by
no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets
no reason for nobody's momma to cry
see i'm a good guy i'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die i know all of my albums support her
this whole year's been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis gray hair maybe
cause i feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
i'm just twentysomeodd years i done lost my mother
and i cried tears of joy i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like ann jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
cause one day we'll all be together sippin heavnly champagne
what angels saw with golden wings in thug's mansion
 wo nas
dear momma don't cry your baby boy's doin good
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night it had me shook
drippin peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sittin there kickin it with malcolm 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cuttin lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on they in heaven found peace at last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what i'm askin
remember this face save me a place in thug's mansion
you probably crooked as the last trick
wanna laugh about how i got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
thinking i had her but she had me in the long run
its just my luck i'm stuck fuckin with wrong one uh
wise decisions based on lies we living
skandalous times is games like my religion
you could be rolling with a thug
instead you with this sweet scrub
looking for some love
in every club i see you standing like you want it
well baby if ya got it better flaunt it
let the liquor help you get up on it
i'm still tipsy from last night
bumpin in walls as i pause
addicted to the fast life
i try to holler but you tell me you're taken
sayin you ain't impressed with the money i'm make
guess its true what they telling me
fresh out of jail life's hell for a black celebrity
so thats the reason why i call
and maybe you with it
fantasies of the sweatin
can i hit it hahaha
addicted to the things you do
its still true what i'm saying boo
cause this is all about u
every other city we go
every other video
its all about you
no matter where i go
i see the same hoe
i'll make a promise if ya go with me
just let me know i'll have you hollering
my name out before i leave
nobody loves me i'm a thug nigga
i only hang out with the criminals and the drug dealers
i love niggas
cause we coming from the same place
witness me holler at a hoochie see how quick the game takes
how can i tell her i'm a playa
and i don't even care
creep though
weed smokes in the air

even the preacher could see the pain in my mothers eyes 
while walkin bye can't help but sympathize when brothas die 
maybe the pain will make the situation change 
no murder for murder our homicide will never end this crooked game 
bullets blastin time pass brothas in masks 
retaliation is the aftermath 
all that remains is a courpse rapped in plastic 
call the mother tell her her babies in a casket 
no love fo 'em 
put his body in the grave 
even the pistols and all the prayers couldn't save 'em 
look how they played 'em

before i let her get me off guard
went in the purse took a hundred dollars

chorus
dangerous and ambitious while schemin on gettin riches
i'm spittin at tricks cause i'm addicted to pretty bitches
currency motivated not easily terminated
now that we made it my niggaz can never be faded
this is my prophecy  i gotta be paid
all you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
i thought we was cool i was a fool thinkin you could be true
when i don't fuck with your punk crew
these are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
i went from hell to livin well
bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
i got no time for them tricks i'm heavy in the game

all you niggaz out there
hahhh hahaha hehehe word
it's like all we got left  teardrops and closed caskets
throw it up fool hey nigga haha
tell me how you feel homey
yeah it took a week to go down
you recollects and see how crazy it sounds
the whole town's on a mission adolescents penitentary bound
now introducin young trigga
since birth eyes set on gettin bigger
just anotha wildass nigga
but he was fiendin for precious what
but precious was a ghetto girl
couldn't be no sex without that gold lexus
but lil' trigga was heartbroken he had to get his papers
seein visions of people smokin and niggaz catchin vapors
got his man from around the corner we'll call him lil' mo
been in so many reform schools they had to let him go
here's where the plot thickens
they got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin
they call the squad hittin blocks with they guns blowin
somebody's gonna die tonight
still no one's knowin so they kept goin
catchin dealers comin out they cars will they survive
two semiautomatic nines them niggaz died
plus nobody in the hood cries it's like they celebrate
 to death and wish they could die  so peep the lesson
but wait a minute back to precious
she's snortin dope in the back seat of trigg's lexus
teardrops and closed caskets
will i forever be alone
teardrops and closed caskets
will i forever be alone
teardrops and closed caskets
don't let these ghetto streets get you precious
was the victim from a dime to a nickel
hopin god's blessings stick with ya
picture the neighborhood kingpin who's gettin bigger
familiar face but a man now it's lil' trigga
now lil' mo was a soldier to the fullest
down for his homies always the first to spit bullets
all he wanted was to be a thug
never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
here's where it gets ya
now precious is pregnant lil' trigga is happy
he wants to marry her now not knowin he ain't the daddy
but precious was lonely while lil' trigga was makin dough
she's slippin in secret places and gettin with lil' mo
the neighborhood's buzzin now people are talkin
lil' trigga's gettin pictures of the both of 'em walkin
hand in hand couldn't understand
how his baby's mama could disapear with another man
and his best friend
now jealousy's dangerous and if you don't believe me
then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
there ain't no heroes or villains ain't no pleasure in killin
just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
teardrops and closed caskets
will i forever be alone
teardrops and closed caskets
bury you dead and look ahead
a man with no feelings
teardrops and closed caskets
will i forever be alone
teardrops and closed caskets
that's all we got left that's all
now with the problems of poverty
and the tricks to these tales
how many people'll die
how many'll live to tell
although best friends before
lil' trigga and mo
they in an all out war over a fiend they ain't know
behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
the results is the same with different names and it turns out
y'all know how it is same old thing in the same old town
lil' trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick now he's played out
think it's lil' mo was plottin plans on gettin bigger
precious was his way to put his hands on lil' trigga
all the while let's look at precious
too dumb to see what's goin down too doped up to ask questions
used to be comrades but now we blast on sight
what could be so bad god will we last tonight
from misdemeanors to felonies smalltime to sellin ki's
i can't believe the shit they tellin me
they open fire three bodies drop so call the cops
precious lil' mo and trigg
teardrops and closed caskets
will i forever be alone

 now you're red again over what he said over what she said
 no matter what i do they got a nigga running from the police
between you and biggie it's like
who's gon' who's gon who rules the the
the nigga kingdom and shit basically you know i'm sayin
i was like this is like a fuckin election
it's an election and shit you know i'm sayin
it isn't it isn't that
me and biggie's situation is smaller than that
me and biggie's situation is like
when i'm in jail strangers was tellin me
like they braggin about it
and that's why what i'm doin i know what i'm doin
i'm destroyin 'em i'm destroyin 'em man
why am i fighting to live if i'm just living to fight
why am i trying to see when there ain't nothin in sight
why am i trying to give when no one gives it a try
why am i fighting to live if i'm just living to die
check it i grew up a fuckin screwup
got introduced to the game got a ounce and fuckin blew up
choppin rocks overnight
the nigga biggie smalls tryin to turn into the black frank white
we had to grow dreads to change our description
two cops is on the milk box missin
show they toes you know they got stepped on
a fist full of bullets a chest full of teflon
run from the police picture that nigga i'm too fat
i fuck around and catch a asthma attack 
that's why i bust back it don't phase me
when he drop take his glock and i'm swayze
celebrate my escape sold the glock bought some weight
laid back i got some money to make motherfucker
keep your mouth shut man you know i'm sayin
just don't feed into it never feed into it
it's gon' do nothin but escalate you know i'm sayin
i know it wasn't true
i know what he thought but what he though wasn't true
it's on me
but still i'm havin memories of high speed when the cops crashed
as i laugh pushin the gas when my glocks blast
we was young and we was dumb but we had heart
in the dark will we survive through the bad parts
many dreams is what i had and plenty wishes
no hesitation in extermination of these snitches
envious bitches they still continue to pursue me
a couple of movies now the whole world's tryin to screw me
even the cops tried to sue me so what can i do
but stay true sippin 22's of brew
and now media is tryin to test me
got the press askin questions tryin to stress me
misery is all i see that's my mindstate
my history with the police is shake the crime rate
my main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped
he screamed thug life and emptied the clip
got tired of runnin from the police
they wanted a new regime
and my regime includes east coast
includes west coast
i was more shocked than anything you know i'm sayin
but i wasn't more shocked of him dying
i was more shocked of him 'pac is a strong dude yo
i know dude you know i'm sayin  real strong
so when they was like he got shot
i was just more like  again
you know i'm sayin  he always gettin shot or shot at
he gon' pull through this one again
make a few records about it and it's gon' be over
you know i'm sayin  but when he when he died
i was just like  whoa you know i'm sayin
kinda took me by
i mean even though we was goin through our drama
i would never wish death on nobody you know i'm sayin
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those 
who can withstand the mo' power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate it's been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard i'm faced with it i'm a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
i'm soon to count the bodies
so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that asss shakin
i'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
who's in control i'm acvtivatin yo souls
you know the way the games get controlled
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat
chorus method man
i got my mind made up come on 
get in get in too 
let it ride  tonight's tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonight's tha night
well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac won't collapse
cause nowaday's shit's evading the xrays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
i'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed that's before it's ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
there's no escape nah i ain't blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mc's i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under seige and i'm jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
i'm out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message don't touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket  blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clan's three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when i'm splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch don't get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs can't fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
with this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
i'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly 
and i'm out for nine nickel 
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin motherfucker's aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda i'm on those
who can withstand the mo' power i gain

murder one style smash piles straight to pebbles
mental terrorist specialist at this
menacing lyricst leave crews defenseless
can't design landmines lick off like nines
to paralyze everything ears ring like doorknobs
heads start to turn like police who pass
hear the blast my crew bust through like tear gas
fuck a mask we laced in place like the marshall
sparkle like live but harder than tarvue
wreck this rhyme start relentless roughest
and fuck up the party for you paying muthafuckas
once i commence for you ladies and gents
i kick rhymes sharper than barbwire fence
the live and direct from killah hill project
staten island new york you can't help but to hawk
lay it on your dental that's if you want it hostile
sounds so underground i write my rhymes on fossil
dudes like this force me to get you open
 poems written by shakur as  interpreted by other artists
god
when i was alone and had nothing
i asked for a friend to help me bear the pain
no one came except god
when i needed a breath to rise from my sleep
no one could help me except god
when all i saw was sadness and i needed answers
no one heard me except god
so when i'm asked who i give my unconditional love to
 poems written by shakur as  interpreted by other artists
it's said that every revolutionary act is a act of love
and this is an act of love
all power to the people
i said the p is for power the a for action
the nt because now is the time to get it done
see the h is for heart and the e for effect
the r hold it down at the end for respect
who am i  a panther
what i got i got soul what i got i got love
what i got i got pride what i wanna be free
raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
who am i  a panther
what i got i got soul what i got i got love
what i got i got pride what i wanna be free
raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
can you see the pride of the panther
as he glows in splendor and grace
topling obstacles placed
in the way of the progression of his race
can you see the pride in the panther
as she nurtures her young all alone
the seed must grow regardless
of the fact that it's planted in stone
can't you see the pride of the panthers
as they unify as one
the flower blooms with brilliance
and outshines the rays of the sun
outshines like the sun
shines out like the sun
shines bright like the sun
brings light like the sun
p is for power the a for action
the nt because now is the time to get it done
see the h is for heart and the e for effect
the r hold it down at the end for respect
who am i  a panther
what i got i got soul what i got i got love
what i got i got pride what i wanna be free
raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
who am i  a panther
what i got i got soul what i got i got love
what i got i got pride what i wanna be free
raise your hands in the air if you feel like me

turn me up turn me up turn me up what
turn me up turn me up turn me up what yeah
turn me up turn me up turn me up what yeah what yeah uh
pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons
meet jamaican like you god you god and 'em handing you lessons
we learn a lot from the 60's like glaring 13 necks
mainly the niggaz get shot for flaring out their larynx
and get to speakin' on a conditions of black people
that's illegal they enforce it with the force that's lethal
make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on
head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it's us
the fbi probably bust a nut if we self destruct
call it militant but ain't nobody killing barry goldwater
you can't be militant if you ain't got no military
but it's still a very powerful word
picture some niggaz with guns got 'em very disturbed word
nowadays you could get shot for a cheap necklace
back then my people bust shots for the free breakfast
now before you see god or stand before allah
you could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
everybody act hard like they got no regard
so we mourn falling stars they still living all hard
we still here word
this is for medgar evers martin and my brother malcom
sometimes we be sittin and wishing for another outcome
my head be spinning it be full of why's and the how come's
the value of life is so cheap if your skin ain't talcum
we need leaders we looking at entertainers
it's about the cash so we respect the biggest gainers
niggaz get paid then they run away from the community
that ain't gangsta nigga you the opposite of huey p
don't be confusing me with haters player
get your paper just show respect to the folks who made you yeah
blessed by the creator so give money nigga
just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry nigga
out on these streets the police is killing
i'm spilling out my heart on these beats so i can feed my children yeah
disrespect and i'm a give you a bar to save your life
because we don't need no more fallen stars
stalk the stage with the pride of the panther
hands off asada and the blood of a dance floor
word rock on throw the tupac on
he's not gone you hear his influence in pop songs
shine brighter than those vegas lights
illuminating that vegas night to the party after the fight
'til the gunshots disturb the peace like luda
too bad he ain't a white chick in aruba
they'd have a whole department dedicated to finding the killer
you'd see afeni shakur on larry king and motherfucking dennis miller
word bill o'reilly would be flapping his gums
how much respect do they have for my people
actually none
you either do the nigga packing a gun who hate niggaz
even though every time he pass a mirror he staring at one
my man stressed 'cause of lack of funds
this the type of shit that make you wanna drown your liver
and blacken your lungs
 x3

dedicated to my heart my ha ha heart
the fear in the heart of a man
dedicated to my heart
against an attacker i will boldly take my stand
  because my heart will show fear for no man
before a broken heart i run with fright
  scared to be blind in the vulnerable night
uhh i believe this fear is in every man
  some will acknowledge it others will fail to understand
uhh uhh uhh uhh there's no fear in a shallow heart
  because the shallow heart is faint and don't fall apart
  because the shallow heart is faint don't fall apart
but feeling hearts that truly care
  are fragile to the flow of air
and if i am to be true then i must give my fragile heart
  my fragile heart
i may receive great joy
or you may return it say it again
