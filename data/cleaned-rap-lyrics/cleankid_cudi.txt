they try to tell me they don't get it they don't know the deal
now i'll be damned i came this far to let a fool live
i gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
but how to be not whack and cheesy to the little kids
so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed
i am exactly who what all the rappers' kids be
and who they love hands to the universe
probably into the drug addicts if they spit a cudi verse
mad little mama sits her down verse all out her purse
long as the booty lookin juicy and he's stylin on 'em
as our hero seems to be dreamin in peace
a dark chapter unfolds throwing scott into the most eerie
and unstable part of his imagination
so intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
whaddup how's everyone doing
you are now in the world i'm ruining
take a minute to adjust to the wonderous
clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
i promise you some generation next shit
speak for the silent who are left with
parallel levels in a dark dark place
tricked all you niggaz to a dark dark fate
and guided you all with a smile upon my face
as the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
gentle with the drugs heavy with the love
and my speeches on stage rock mountains from above
money doesn't move me except in the literal
g4 flights now we're off to australia
i want to see more of the world
these are more than just words these are facts from a winner
this is a journey into the horizon
you can see past if it's real to youuuuu
we can meet on the other side on the other side ayyy
this is a journey into the horizon
you can see past if it's real to youuuuu
and we can meet on the other side on the other side
whaddup how's everyone feeling
i hope you understand what you're hearing
take a minute to roll up for the wonderous
clusterfuck of darkness and evil
i will paint the yin and yang for ya
and my jeans are dior for the love of skinnys
upgraded faded aided to the t
work hard makin sure i don't become a memory
harder to press on when the memories remember me
and they always find the perfect moment
high speed my momentum won't slow up none
lost in the wind i've lost all my friends
maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
money seems to make everything tainted
everybody mad cause they stuck where i knew 'em last
took what i wanted and i did it all blunted oh ohhh
hey

if you feel it muthafucka you can't go wrong

long before we know ourselves our paths are already set in stone
some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
there are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
content with being blinded by rules and judgment
we live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
in this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
not many people stood up against the system we all call life
but toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
a voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
a voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
this is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
i got 99 problems and they all bitches
i wish i was jigga man carefree living
but i'm not shawn or martin louis
i'm a cleveland nigga rolling with them brooklyn boys
you know how it be when you start living large
i control my own life charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the drama
or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted how'd you do it mom huh
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself why he by himself
he got two older brothers one hood one good
an independent older sister got me fly when she could
but they all didn't see the little bit of sadness in me scotty
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you
it's only right
this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life
i'm super paranoid like a 6th sense
since my father died i ain't been writing since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split an eighth of shrooms just so i could see the universe
i tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room and soon i'm consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
its all said and done and my cock's been sucked
so now i'm in the cut alcohol in the womb
my hearts an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cancun
where it is never sunny the dark side of the moon
so it's more than life i try to shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand
i've got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you
it's only right
this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life
it's close to go and trying some coke
and a happy ending is slitting my throat
ignorance the coke man
ignorance is bliss
ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then i'd probably be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then i'd probably be a jackass
don't give a shit what people talkin' bout fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 30
wanna settle down stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty
i just need a thoroughbred cook when i'm hungry
ass all chunky brain is insanity
only things that calm me down pussy and some cali trees
and i get both never truly satisfied
i am happy that's just the saddest lie
i've got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you
it's only right
abc 
123 abc abc 
simple as that for your simple ass
ask about that pretty simple math
i'm dreamin on good for a sicker plan
sicker than any other nigga could be thinkin man
i can't be a loser coulda figured that
i can't be a lame i'm cooler than that
i feel i love the fame then i hate it back
thinking now what i should be twitterin
why'd big bro take all the hot bitches
dear god me too i like the hot bitches
i'll be the underdog all along 'til i'm gone
i will live through this song i'll be strong through the haters
as simple as that 
as simple as that for your simple ass
as simple as that 
as simple as that for your simple ass
as simple as that 
as simple as that for your simple ass
as simple as that 
as simple as 123
uhh simple as that for your simple ass
timple way i wish you woulda called it how it shoulda been
they try to tell me they don't get it they don't know the deal
now i'll be damned i came this far to let a fool live
i gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
but how to be not whack and cheesy to the little kids
so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed
i am exactly who what all the rappers' kids be
and who they love hands to the universe
probably into the drug addicts if they spit a cudi verse
mad little mama sits her down verse all out her purse
long as the booty lookin juicy and he's stylin on 'em
as our hero seems to be dreamin in peace
a dark chapter unfolds throwing scott into the most eerie
and unstable part of his imagination
so intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
listen good i don't have nobody
but what i might feel are the sounds of sanity
hoping what i hear loops itself continuously
then i won't be afraid no no
ohwhoawhoawhoa
why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right
ohwhoawhoawhoa
soaring through paradise when i'm closing my eyes
i'm mr solo dolo
oh oh oh
oh oh
look at me uou tell me
just what you see

ohwhoawhoawhoa
why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right
ohwhoawhoawhoa
soaring through paradise when i'm closing my eyes
i'm mr solo dolo
oh oh oh
oh oh
my world turns
flippin the bird
to the ones who figure me
outkast no not the duo
back at shaker heights
when they knew who
though little brother was a strange one
boo hoo cry me a river
hey look who try without an igloo
cold cold world wasn't fit for me at all
look at where i stand at tall 
clutchin' my kid cudi bizzalls
mute mutherfucker back home quick pause
gargle on my mayo
look at me i bet i'm the one you picked to fail
floatin in my mind no sail
ahoy ahoy
listen good i don't need nobody
this is what you feel are the sounds of insanity
hoping what i hear loops itself to finish me
no i won't be afraid
hey hey
ohwhoawhoawhoa
why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right
ohwhoawhoawhoa
soaring through paradise when i'm closing my eyes
i'm mr solo dolo
why must it feel so right when i know that it's wrong it's wrong
when will i ever learn from the words from my songs
pleae save a kid that needs some help 
and 
i can't begin to think of anything that could help 
but the weed is guaranteed indeed just what i need 
how i feel upon a time so recent in time make me sad 
when i recollect how it use to be like david and goliath 
kinda like me and the devil tryna rip out my soul 
tryna catch a nigga on sleep no no 
you can try again and i'll be ready 
won't let you kill me in my dream like freddy 
krueger 
no i'm not no loser 
won't see you in hell
at the end of the day day
my momma told me dont let no one break me 
let no one break me 
at the end of the day day nobody nobody
ever could stop me ever could stop me
at the end of the day day
you can't regret it if you were trying 
if you were trying 
at the end of the day day 
i'm walkin with a heart of a lion yeah
please save a kid that needs some help 
and i can't see ahead of me so i move in stealth 
hide and seek 
within a dream i seem to glide above my horror though 
i feel i'll never be complete inside the dark i borrow 
to proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable 
and they talk and judge a man 
they have no clue of what im capable 
til i show a side of me no one had thought could be within 
i told you no i'm not a loser 
i'll see you in hell
bridge 
no no no no no no no no
yeah no yeah
i'm just a kid who needs no help 
i've achieved a bigger thing 
no cash or check could be more blessed 
and if you would've seen the things ive seen up in my slumber 
you'd be shook stay awake no need to run your fate will follow 
you should know 
not for the faint at heart this world understands no coward 
it's a goal a simple code i stay on the grind to the 25th hour 
and i know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within 
i told you no i'll never let you drag me down to hell
  billy cravens
hello

took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely
lonely in my room i i mean me up on the moon
entertained myself laughed at myself
as i grew to be a teen i disguised myself
at the lowest selfesteem especially with the girls
tried out every sport just to impress all the girls
instead of all the ladies cause they talk down

somethin' special i am learnin' to
until then i go
away very far away
to another universe where all the people say
it's that new new place for the special to embrace
like a martian who seemingly wandered out of place
take what you need from the valley of the hopeful
where even if you drown you'll be floatin' high 'em

soon after falling into a deep but psychedelic state to escape the prison of our reality
our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place which immediately becomes his sanctuary
a place filled with his wildest dreams
everytime the moon shines i become alive yeah
and everytime the moon shines i become alive yeah
i'm feeling strange in the night
i'm in myself i feel i'm thrown into a fight
nowhere to run nowhere to hide nothing's right
my skin is burning when my rock begins to speak

i am changing rapidly
i'm feeling stronger more alert i'm on the move
i smell her scent and i know i will find her soon soon soon
the one to come and free me from this fate

a sexy lady who's pure she has the cure uh

nananananananana whoa
soarin' is this allowed
i sure bet my daddy proud
a little nigga wit a shaker smile
on top of the dreams is where i'm found
some figured i was satan bound
until i came back with a style i found
then all of the sudden they fixed they faces
cause of who i know and trail of places that i've stepped
how many niggas wanna hate cause i left
how could you blame me and my plan of attack
cause i'm risking my soul attack
now i'm heard all over the map
only rule of thumb it don't really matter just where you from
all that really matter is where you're goin' go
maybe upstate for some
but you can't rule out these claps for gun
second chances given out for some
all you gotta do is take advantage
so maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
been pimpin you can think about marriage
until then get it then
find yourself and let's begin
i'mma tell you how in a minute
i'mma show you how i be livin'
from a long time ago a young nigga he was timid
now i'm zone and see things so vivid
hide my soul nah homie not even
i'mma zone out till i lose feeling
remember i'mma be gone way past november
even stay up there up there 
floatin floatin' hopin' i could find peace somewhere
in my mind sounds like oh
when i'm gone it feels like oh
when i zone i'm feeling alright
i'm feeling alright
when i zone i'm feeling alright
i'm feeling alright
i forget about it all
ballin' is this allowed
without feelin' like shallow hal
comma's on the jesus piece for style
back in cleveland city we ride around
greetin' my niggas wit dap and pounds
so if i fall i won't hit the ground
these are the things that'll make me smile
knowin' this blunt might burn a while 
i keep myself so lifted 
i am accustomed to new heights
i feel perfect though they think it's worthless see without my flight
man everybody wanna be a critic
i have my life and i will live it
shut your mouth before i fuck it
ha my jokes they will love it
if i'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
more than likely i am fadin' man
doin' other shit if everywhere you go niggas ain't just standin' round hatin'
so my advice is when the lights start flashin' 
i'll be zonin' all alone 
and then the place where my mind is goin' 
filled with songs that no one's knowin'
and the devil in a hot pink dress tryin' to ask me for one dance
he think he slick but my guardians protect me from his wrath
so in my place no hate shall enter
livin' high up there up there
copin' copin' floatin' i will find peace somewhere
 repeat 2x
in my mind sounds like oh
when i'm gone it feels like oh
when i zone i'm feeling alright
i'm feeling alright i'm feeling alright
when i zone i'm feeling alright
i'm feeling alright

it began my dream and imaginations
perfectly at peace so i move along a bit higher
i'll be up up and away

the end is never the end a new challenge awaits
a test no man could be prepared for
a new hell he must conquer and destroy
a new level of growth he must confront himself
the machine in the ghost within
alright run it
i never gave a fuck i never a fuck about what niggas thought about me 
i mean i did but like fuck it you know what i'm sayin 
you gon' love me man 
you gon' love me man
they can't comprehend or even come close to understanding him 
i guess if i was boring they would love me more 
guess if i was simple in the mind 
everything would be fine 
maybe if i was jerk to girls 
instead of being nice and speaking kind words 
then maybe it would be okay to say then i wasn't a good guy to begin with
but my mind is all crazy crazy crazy crazy 
they got me thinking i ain't human
like i came in from above above above above 
feelin' like a airplane in the sky 
but then they say i'm crazy crazy crazy crazy 
they got me thinking i ain't human
like i came in from above above above above 
feelin' like a bird sittin' high high
i be that man on the moon 
i'm that man on the moon 
and i'mma do what i do 
so do you hey hey 
i be posted with my blunt and a brew my dude

like it's a bad thing and i be like why not nigga
close my eyes high in the dark 
it's a curtain call come one come all 
all i do is try to make it simple 
the ones that make it complicated never get congratulated 
i'm somethin' different all aspects 
don't want a woman just to love her assets 
i still wife her up even with her flat chest 
the type to get hurt but that's the past tense
my mind is all hazy hazy hazy hazy 
i be thinkin' that i'm wrong cause they used to call me lame lame lame lame 
my swag was a little different 
but then my mind is hazy hazy hazy hazy 
i be thinkin' that i'm wrong
but they the ones who lame lame lame lame 
i got the last laugh nigga

i'm that man on the moon 
and i'mma do what i do

whaddup how's everyone doing
you are now in the world i'm ruining
take a minute to adjust to the wonderous
clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
i promise you some generation next shit
speak for the silent who are left with
parallel levels in a dark dark place
tricked all you niggaz to a dark dark fate
and guided you all with a smile upon my face
as the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
gentle with the drugs heavy with the love
and my speeches on stage rock mountains from above
money doesn't move me except in the literal
g4 flights now we're off to australia
i want to see more of the world
these are more than just words these are facts from a winner
this is a journey into the horizon
you can see past if it's real to youuuuu
we can meet on the other side on the other side ayyy
this is a journey into the horizon
you can see past if it's real to youuuuu
and we can meet on the other side on the other side
whaddup how's everyone feeling
i hope you understand what you're hearing
take a minute to roll up for the wonderous
clusterfuck of darkness and evil
i will paint the yin and yang for ya
and my jeans are dior for the love of skinnys
upgraded faded aided to the t
work hard makin sure i don't become a memory
harder to press on when the memories remember me
and they always find the perfect moment
high speed my momentum won't slow up none
lost in the wind i've lost all my friends
maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
money seems to make everything tainted
everybody mad cause they stuck where i knew 'em last
took what i wanted and i did it all blunted oh ohhh

the moonlight kissing the lips on a model frame
i kissed her inner thigh
closed my eyes she began to make me fish
she like to go the mile
all the while i could see her tear a bit
i forget her name somethin that sound like penelope
maybe a french twang to it
her tongue was quick she was french i knew it
a lovely foreigner foreign to racism
she like that young nigga vibe
my brown skin my shagged out 'fro
i'm king to her and she will please her friend for me
so funny how the starvin are godless

don't focus where you been g focus where you tryin to go
i swear the game make you cold like abominable
snowman old man when you tryin to shine like gold
when it's my time to blow partner i'ma know
in the midst of gettin dough i was hit with highs and lows
my mellow tried to play me like my fuckin eyes was closed
now i'm sittin here wishin that my guys didn't know
they love a g so they despise his soul
what they gon' do to him beyond my control
when the reaper calls it's your time to go
never play a nigga when you see that he is tryin to grow
he'd be benny blanco when he knocked out carlito
and pachenga so i'm watchin every angle
under the moonlight with the devil i tangle
church on the move like jesus in the manger
better control of money is better control of anger
so now i watch a friend the way that i watch a stranger
chuuch
  2x
uhh chillin rollin up somethin to change my feelin
thinkin about how i came up from nothin while i'm splittin
this cigarillo phone rings i get a call
one of my dawgs trippin hard talkin 'bout runnin and killin 'em all
niggaz just ran in yo' crib and popped yo' daughter in the spleen
we wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
i didn't know that this was all a setup secretly they want me wet up
jealous of my future cheddar however
they fastest move was too slow for me
i pulled up wasn't no ambulance and wasn't no police
somethin fishy goin on naive kept pressin on
nine gripped thinkin the killer could still be on the lawn
opened the front do' they shot i shot someone dropped shit
the nigga with somethin to lose just almost lost it
won't trust him again
  2x
cheese came through at 3 salute at ease
he had supplied the weed cause i'd been that od
it's me with the black rock star steez
real rock tees three hundred a pop for these
please bummy you don't know me money
sippin on a heiny with my jamie boo beside me
that's my fuckin best friend when i'm tweakin she be calmin a brother
like the touch from a mother
i'm so damn comfortable i never want to leave it
the feeling is somethin like the spiritual healer
that could end me i think that's part i find intriguing
a little bit off i am i am i am
i see that i'm caught i am i am i am
it's somethin like the spiritual healer that could end me
i think that's part i find intriguing i'm fiending
hey  mamama mamoon 
when the days change
so does my attitude
i'm messy at home
i ate a lot of junk food
when the nights change
so do my nightmares too
i dream reality
is my dream
all along all along
i guess i'm meant to be alone
all along all along
i guess i'm meant to be alone
out there on my own yeah
when the weeks change
the rumors change too
i'm addicted to highs
but would you like to know why
when the months change
so do my love point of views
i don't want what i need
what i need hates me 
i know all along all along
i know i'm meant to be alone
it's crazy
but all along all along
i knew i was meant to be alone
out there on my own yeah
i suppose somehow the lionhearted failed to win
who will be the villain all the strangers voted for him
i suppose somehow the lionhearted failed to smile
who will be the villain all the strangers voted for him
all along all along
i guess i'm meant to be alone
all along all along
i guess i'm meant to be alone
you see i'm trapped in my mind oh i'm goin trippy
oh i don't think i'll ever go
you see the walls are so high that i couldn't climb them

the lonely loner seem to free his mind at night ahah at nite
