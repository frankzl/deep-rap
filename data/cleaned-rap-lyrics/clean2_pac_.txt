as real as it seems the american dream
ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history of mystery but now i see
the american dream wasn't meant for me
cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause i'm strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promise me emancipation indispute nation
all you gave my people was our patience
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my answer shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a damn thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now i'm sitting here mad cause i'm unemployed
but the government's glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power
panther power
coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then i'll yell out
panther power
my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldn't settle for being a statistic
couldn't survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
cause i'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what i'm asking you
you think you living free don't let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
panter power
panther power
as real as it seems the american dream
ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names

i called dizzy whats up

he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long 'til your beat
and then it hit me damn
i got a battle at 6
with out my microphone
i'm guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
i'm a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasn't no use
i tried to rock it onetwo onetwo
but i couldn't get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got yo what if ya loose
it'd be the first time i lost
but if i beat 'em it'd finally prove that i'm the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets

strictly dope won't get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back ha
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
'cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
let knowledge drop
why should i be forced to play dumb
i know where i came from so i'm going to claim some
but rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
stop think of the past the brothers that die for
sucker to try for never to cry more
tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
he's a fake not a friend
so he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
yo he's a trick so he sold his soul for gold
now i know the reason we must excel
cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
move on be strong with unity
cause that's the only way to build communities
lies are told but yo lives must move on
and never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
yo i'm running so i refuse to stop
get sweated by them sell out cops
and i wink cause i pin the opposition
i'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
so listen up to the flavor i gave you now dropping it
we folks know ballers know no stopping it
dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
i got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm 
for the simple fact that i'm black and educated
proud of who am i and you hated
so all i have tried for this many have die for this
you see it and you hear it and you loving it

aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
suckers suffocate when i hype this because you can write this
you constantly bite this
thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
caught with the dope dose
now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
cause you building a boom force
like what you hearing so your checking with the source
tupac brother with the rhymes to rock on
dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
i'm not conceited but defeated i won't be
as long as there's dope beats i'll never be lonely stop
and let me breathe a minute
aiyyo dizzy what's up put the base back in it
let knowledge drop 
by any means neccessary it's kind of scary
knowledge of the hands of adversaries
makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
i was waiting for a present god gave me a goal
i refuse to be busting like a sucker for i'm fighting like a titan
and run you down like a truck
i'll take a chance i vote for rock can see
not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
knowledge appealed to me
pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
the bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
and knowledge drops
drop that

the box with the big beats and my boys started illin'

a ten minute game and we were the winners
the boys started smackin' talkin' that slack and
till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
tried to say we cheat because he got beat
another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
it's not to understand it's just a day in the life
kick it  it's just a day in the life
2pac

got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
but i was all alone so it wasn't no thing
got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
picked it up the salutations little bit frustrations
who could be disturbin' me on my vacation
speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
now i know what michael meant by leave me alone
so i'm askin' who is it and the answer shocks me
it was the voice of my homeboy roct

we get out the car and can barely stand
cause everywhere i look are screamin' fans
girls on my tip but i really don't sweat 'em
they'll tear my new clothes if your bodygurad'll let 'em
hit backstage with two minutes to spare
just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
we hear the introduction the audience is loud
i stepped out on the stage and then i moved the crowd
winners all over we tried to leave the scene
but there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
pen and paper in my face i couldn't be mean
so i was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
it's not hard to understand it's just a day in the life
kick it  it's a day in the life
kick it kick it kick it

knew i was a genius soon as you seen this
avoid hoe's value don't have to redeem this
teenage terror no room for error
a girl start dissin' and i scare her
risin' like inflation on your favorite station
rap is my forte and my recreation
girls wanna kiss me suckers wanna diss me
my mother didn't want me to be but i'ma emcee
the ladies desire emcees admire
that's why many hate me and call me liar
hoods of the hypetip girls on the illtrip
i'm through rockin' this whack so that's it
i am the high type my style is so right
i lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me i'd playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger
you sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer
huh  reach for my drink and for a second we touch
words are muttered i stutter cause i want you that much
the situation is a nowin cause he's my best friend
but now i'm guilty of fallin for his girlfriend
i know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
i offer passion but he offers security
its like a trap that i'm sinkin into
i wake up sweaty when i'm sleepin cause i'm thinkin of you
then we make eye contact and i can't hold back
i try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
what have i gotten into i feel posessed by you
i have these thoughts at night of undressin you
its kinda obvious blind men might see it
but he doesn't so he keeps on trustin me
leaves me alone wit you while he's on vacation
well how could he leave me with this temptation
now i'm confused cause i'm no casanova
but you keep callin  you're sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
girl you are my one and only
you are my angel and now ya wanna leave me lonely
what did i do  baby did i treat you bad
my heart is broken and now ya make me sad
i remember when this love affair first started
we was so in love and now we are departed
girl i'll buy ya anything ya heart desires
i have to let ya know baby you're my fire
warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
it's your sweet caress that makes rock t strong
just bein with you and seein the two of us
walkin along the beach cause girl you are my peach
so sweet and tender my love i surrender
no need to pretend that you'll want it to end
i'll never let you go you're forever my girl
ya know why  cause girl you are my world
my burnin' heart
totally tongue tied every three seconds i keep watchin you
he's my best friend but i can't help clockin you
how could this be  how could we both love you
now i'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when i'm here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond that's already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you don't matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we can't wait to taste each other
you're my addiction cause i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because you're next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
it's too hard to conceal so i know it's for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so i'm feelin nervous
i wanna tell you how i feel but that wouldn't help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words you're sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldn't hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart
my heart is burnin ya know it's yearin for ya sweet caress
i lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
you know ya love me why must you deny yourself
what i can offer you yet you want somebody else
it's not that  well then girl what could it be
i hope i'm good for you cause baby you're so good for me
many nights i cried and tried to make this work
then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
well i'm sorry baby i have to let you know
you are my life my strength i refuse to let you go
you are so beautiful baby you light up my life
i close my eyes and dream of that you'll become my wife
day in and day out it's you i pray about
don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
i love you cause honey you're like a work of art
you got me on fire  my burnin heart
i lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me i'd playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger

i know this girl and her name is minnie
livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldn't quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
2pac
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block i'm from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin' minnie out with the little social climbin'
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
that's is my memory of minnie the moocher
ray tyson
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin' for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin' somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
ray tyson
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin'
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin'
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin'
she would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
 send corrections to the typist

i try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
i'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
cause i ain't a crook despite how i look
i don't sell llello
they're judging a brother like covers and books
follow me into a flow
i'm sure you know which way to go
i'm hittin 'em out of the dopes
so slip on the slope let's skip on the flow
i'm fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddya know it's off with some clothes
that let's me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when i'm collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack
i rendered up piles of black
the wacker the pack the fatter the smack
i hate it when real nigga bust
they hate when i cuss they threaten to bust
i had enough of the fuss
i bust what i bust and cuss when i must
they gave me a charge for sales
for selling the tales of young black males
yes nigga nigga niggaz
        ay nigga you can't handle that shit

        i tell you what  you guys are not gonna be talking
        all that shit when i come back ok
        we gonna say who the big mouth when i come back
you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin' out worse often when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin' up
getting drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get 'em i'll hit 'em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart you'll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didn't do a thing at all
i'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didn't know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but it's a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame it's a shame because the man's slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldn't find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie don't play that
it's time i let 'em suffer the payback
i'm tryin to avoid physical contact
i can't hold back it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
can't use the phone 
cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
did it before
ain't scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now he's the devils friend
too late to be tellin' him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasn't thinkin' all i heard was the ridicule
i fired my weapon
started steppin' in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin' a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin' for my getaway
coppers said freeze or you'll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldn't see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped

chorus 3
chorus 4
chorus 5
chorus 6
killing us one by one 
in one way or another
american will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one 
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
brothers sisters niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight 
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin' better livin'
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but we're the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me it's all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it don't apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobody's gonna like what i pumpin'
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
i'm fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
there's much more to life than just poverty
this is definitly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika america  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidence
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i don't get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day i'm gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
they're pulling your sleave don't believe 
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i can't explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother that's living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took out king
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
nightmare thats what i am
america's nightmare
i am what you made me
the hate and evil that you gave me
i shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for four hundred plus years
you should be scared 
you should be running
you should be trying to silence me
ha ha 
but you can not escape fate
well it is my turn to come
just as you rose you shall fall
by my hands
amerika you reap what you sow
2pacalypse america's nightmare
ice cube and da lench mob america's nightmare
above the law america's nightmare
paris america's nightmare
public enemy america's nightmare
krsone america's nightmare
mutulu shakur america's nightmare
geronimo pratt america's nightmare

ever since you was a peewee down by my knee with a weewee
we been coochiecoo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasn't
but like the old saying goes
time goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope game my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with ak's
and though i been around clowning with the underground
i'm still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for y'all if my homies call
it's a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
you got fame now you run with no shame
i chose rap tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i don't wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go you're not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
i'll be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother only on his cover
i'd be no different than the others
h to the o to the m to the i to the e
i'm down to the end
cause it's a fall in no time at all
i'm down for y'all when my homies call
word if my homies call
well it's ninety one and i'm livin kinda swell now
but i hear that you're going through some hell pal
but life makin records ain't easy
it ain't what i expected it's hectic it's sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
it's fate it wasn't my choice to make
to be great i'm giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
that's why i wrote this song if you ever need me it's on
no matter who the foe they must fall
brenda's got a baby
i hear brenda's got a baby
well brenda's barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
that's not her problem that's up to brenda's family
well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms
and her dad was a junky puttin death into his arm
it's sad cause i bet brenda doesn't even know
just cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
but oh that's a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didn't really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems to notice any change in her figure
she's 12 years old and she's having a baby
in love with a molester who's sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so
she didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought she'd get away wouldn't hear the cries
she didn't realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in the trash heep balling
momma can't help her but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants to run away momma say you makin' me lose pay
the social workers here everyday
now brenda's gotta make her own way
can't go to her family they won't let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldn't keep a job
she tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now what's next there ain't nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
