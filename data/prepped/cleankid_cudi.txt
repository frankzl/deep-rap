everything turns out dope ; right here in my dreams ; welcome yeah ; welcome you are in my dreams nah ; ; long before we know ourselves our path are already set in stone ; some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will ; there are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in ; contents with being blinded by rules and judgment ; we live in a world where it is more okay to follow than to lead ; in this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to ; being a leader in this day and age is being a threat ; not many people stood up against the system we all call life ; but coward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice ; a voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time ; a voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotion ; and issue never before heard so vividly and honest ; this is the story of a young man who not only believe in himself but his dreams too ; i got ninety nine problems and they all bitches ; i wish i was nigga man carefree living ; but i am not shown or martin louis ; i am a cleveland nigga rolling with them brooklyn boys ; you know how it be when you start living large ; i control my own life charges was never in charge ; no sitcom could teach scott about the drama ; or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom ; on christmas time my mom christmas grind ; got me most of what i wanted how did you do it mom huh ; she popped the boys i would play with in my room by myself why he by himself ; he got two older brothers one hood one good ; an independent older sister got me fly when she could ; but they all did not see the little bit of sadness in me shotty ; give got some issue that nobody can see ; and all of these emotion are pouring out of me ; i bring them to the light for you ; it is only right ; this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life ; i am super paranoid like a sixth sense ; since my father died i is not been writing since ; and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe ; split an eighty of shrooms just so i could see the universe ; i tried to think about myself as a sacrifice ; just to show the kids they is not the only ones who up at night ; the moon will illuminate my room and soon i am consumed by my doom ; once upon a time nobody gave a fuck ; its all said and done and my cock is been fucked ; so now i am in the cut alcohol in the bomb ; my hearts an open some that i hope heads soon ; i live in a cocoon opposite of cancun ; where it is never sunny the dark side of the moon ; so it is more than life i try to shed some light on a man ; not many people of this planet understand ; i have got some issue that nobody can see ; and all of these emotion are pouring out of me ; i bring them to the light for you ; it is only right ; this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life ; it is close to go and trying some coke ; and a happy ending is spitting my throat ; ignorance the coke man ; ignorance is bless ; ignorance is love and i need that shit ; if i never did shows then i would probably be a myth ; if i cared about the blows then i would probably be a jackass ; do not give a shit what people talking but fam ; haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on dick ; hope i really get to see thirty ; wanna settle down stop being so flirt ; most of the clean faces be the most dirty ; i just need a thoroughbred cook when i am hungry ; ass all chunks brain is insanity ; only things that calm me down pussy and some cali trees ; and i get both never truly satisfied ; i am happy that is just the baddest lie ; i have got some issue that nobody can see ; and all of these emotion are pouring out of me ; i bring them to the light for you ; it is only right ; lbc ; twenty three lbc lbc ; simple as that for your simple ass ; ask about that pretty simple mash ; i am dreaming on good for a sicker plan ; sicker than any other nigga could be thinking man ; i can not be a lose could figured that ; i can not be a lame i am cooler than that ; i feel i love the fame then i hate it back ; thinking now what i should be twitterin ; why did big bro take all the hot bitches ; dear god me too i like the hot bitches ; i will be the underdog all along until i am gone ; i will live through this song i will be strong through the haters ; as simple as that ; as simple as that for your simple ass ; as simple as that ; as simple as that for your simple ass ; as simple as that ; as simple as that for your simple ass ; as simple as that ; as simple as twenty three ; uh simple as that for your simple ass ; simple way i wish you woulda called it how it shoulda been ; they try to tell me they do not get it they do not know the deal ; now i will be damned i came this far to let a fool live ; i gotta terminated the hate spread the positive ; but how to be not whack and cheese to the little kids ; so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed ; i am exactly who what all the rapper is i kids be ; and who they love hands to the universe ; probably into the drug addicts if they spit a audi verse ; mad little mama its her down verse all out her purse ; long as the booty looking juice and he is styling on them ; as our her seems to be dreaming in peace ; a dark chapter unfolds throwing scott into the most eerie ; and unstable part of his i am going togination ; so intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality ; listen good i do not have nobody ; but what i might feel are the sounds of sanity ; hoping what i hear looks itself continuously ; then i will not be afraid no no ; ohwhoawhoawhoa ; why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right ; ohwhoawhoawhoa ; staring through paradise when i am closing my eyes ; i am mr solo solo ; oh oh oh ; oh oh ; look at me you tell me ; just what you see ; am i someone who you may love or enemy ; am i speaking for you and yours or someone else ;

oh oh oh ; oh oh ; my world turns ; flipping the bird ; to the ones who figure me ; outkast no not the duo ; back at shake heights ; when they knew who ; though little brother was a strange one ; boo how cry me a river ; hey look who try without an igloo ; cold cold world was not fit for me at all ; look at where i stand at tall ; clutching my kid audi bizzalls ; cute motherfucker back home quick pause ; gargle on my may ; look at me i bet i am the one you picked to fail ; floating in my mind no said ; ahoy ahoy ; listen good i do not need nobody ; this is what you feel are the sounds of insanity ; hoping what i hear looks itself to finish me ; no i will not be afraid ; hey hey ; ohwhoawhoawhoa ; why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right ; ohwhoawhoawhoa ; staring through paradise when i am closing my eyes ; i am mr solo solo ; why must it feel so right when i know that it is wrong it is wrong ; when will i ever learn from the words from my songs ; please save a kid that needs some help ; and ; i can not begin to think of anything that could help ; but the weed is guaranteed indeed just what i need ; how i feel upon a time so recent in time make me sad ; when i recollect how it use to be like davis and goliath ; kinda like me and the devil trying to rip out my soul ; trying to catch a nigga on sleep no no ; you can try again and i will be ready ; will not let you kill me in my dream like freddy ; krueger ; no i am not no lose ; will not see you in hell ; at the end of the day day ; my momma told me done let no one break me ; let no one break me ; at the end of the day day nobody nobody ; ever could stop me ever could stop me ; at the end of the day day ; you can not regret it if you were trying ; if you were trying ; at the end of the day day ; i am walking with a heart of a lion yeah ; please save a kid that needs some help ; and i can not see ahead of me so i move in stealth ; hide and seek ; within a dream i seem to glide above my horror though ; i feel i will never be complete inside the dark i borrow ; to proceed and remain infact my mental is so unstable ; and they talk and judge a man ; they have no clue of what i capable ; til i show a side of me no one had thought could be within ; i told you no i am not a lose ; i will see you in hell ; blidge ; no no no no no no no no ; yeah no yeah ; i am just a kid who needs no help ; i have achieved a bigger thing ; no cash or check could be more blessed ; and if you would have seen the things give seen up in my slumber ; you would be shook stay awake no need to run your fate will follow ; you should know ; not for the faint at heart this world understands no coward ; it is a goal a simple code i stay on the grind to the twenty fifth hour ; and i know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within ; i told you no i will never let you drug me down to hell ; billy cravens ; hell ; yeah ; little homie in the room ; in in the room ; boy on the moon ; had had no one ; no one to hang out with ; talk that shit to just my little homies ; one year younger doing get where i was going ; took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely ; lonely in my room i i mean me up on the moon ; entertainer myself laughed at myself ; as i grew to be a teen i disguise myself ;
