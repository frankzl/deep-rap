ghetto of crime on the grind pull an iron out ; industry crying out major label buying out ; who put the fire out real hip hop is dying out ; sound like the perfect time for a to set off the new beginning ; let me finish where nas left off ; i went to la to get with dre we tried to blidge the rap and ; take night mix it with day i guess it was not meant to happen ; my move a gotta dudes hope i lose but it is cool baby ; bounce like medallions till it is off the chain ; and i remain up in the la till it is engulfed in flames ; a new block like times square and forty do wop ; without the gun on my hip i bring the new hop ; for scott larock freaky ty l eye biggie smalls and tupac ; so where my goons at stand up we right here ; where my thugs at stand up we right here ; and all the ogs stand up we right here ; bounce for yourself homie make yourself be heard ; but you do not have to dance play it cool and listen ; because you know what this is we give them the business ; your crew is number i if not best and better ; here is a hit the with letter ; this is hell and hell is where the storm is drugs sellers killed for cornets ; death is here to hunt us the president is still in office ; the heavens hear the horror and let us feel what war is ; deadly leather still before us to sever seal upon us ; rakim up here begin to fear the end is here your goners ; stuff as rigarmortis now let them feel the chorus ; the god spit i am still here you all stick for real performance ; record deal and touring my rap is still enormous ; i hit the block or party and mommies be watching pappy ; the show get smashed photographed by the paparazzi ; my army is on it highly do not bring no drama by me ; it is deadly periods pointblank flash kamikaze ; the alpha and omega no doubt an innovator ; in front of your bodega it is the style originator ; you doubters and you haters a but to end your date ; with writer is block i am off the top without the pen no paper ; the archaeologist let you all acknowledge it ; then i start the apocalypse then watch the god demolish it ; i heard the news there is a dude they wanna hear from ; take it from square one lace up them air ones ; then bring the new commandments to the planet ; for living life in the hood and for the music fanatics ; it is for dimes and done and for my love of writing songs ; when the club mic is on i am on my justice cipher hold back ; so where my goons at stand up we right here ; where my thugs at stand up we right here ; and all the ogs stand up we right here ; bounce for yourself homie make yourself be heard ; but you do not have to dance play it cool and listen ; because you know what this is we give them the business ; your crew is number i if not best and better ; i is not no joke i use to let the mic smoke ; now i sam it when i am done and make sure it is broke ; when i am gone no on gets on because i will not let ; nobody press up and mess up the scene i set ; but think about it then you will understand ; i am just an addict addicted to music ; maybe it is a habit i gotta use it ; even if it is jayz or the quiet storm ; i hook a beat up convert it into hiphop for ; write a rhyme in grafitti and every show you see me in ; deep concentration because i am no comedian ; jokes are wild if you wanna be named ; i treat you like a child then you are gonna be named ; another enemy not even a friend of me ; because you will get tried in the end when you pretend to be ; composing because i just put your mind on pause ; and i complete when you compare my rhyme with yours ; i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned ; remember me the one you got your idea from ; but soon you start to suffer the tone will get rougher ; when you start to stutter that is when you had enough of ; biting it will make you choke you can not provoked ; you can not cope you should have broke because i is not no joke ; i got a question it is serious as cancer ; who can keep the average dance ; hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling ; because you are expression the rhyme that i am styling ; this is what we all sit down to write ; you can not make it so you take it home break it and bite ; use pieces and its of all my hiphop hits ; get the style down pat then it is time to switch ; put my tape on pause and and some more to yours ; then you figured you are ready for the neighborhood chorus ; a emcee do not even try to be ; when you come up to speak do not even lie to me ; you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate ; then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me ; so when you see me come up freeze ; or you will be one of those seven mc is ; they think that i am a new jack but only if they knew that ; they who think wrong are they who can not do that ; style that i am down they might run ; patterns of paragraphs based on you and ; your offbeat dj if anything he play ; sound familiar i will wait until e say ; you can get a smack for this i is not no joke ; i hold the microphone like a grudge ; b will hold the record so the needle do not judge ; i hold a conversation because when i invest ; when i see you i will kick a freestyle going steadily ; but whatever you do do not miss one ; there will be another rough rhyme after this one ; before you know it you are followin and fiending ; waiting for the punchline to get the meaning ; like before the middle of my story i am telling ; nobody beats the r so stop yelling ; save it put it in your pocket for later ; no interruptions until the mic is broke ; when i am gone then you can joke ; because everything is real on a serious tip ; keep playing and i get furious quick ; and i will take you for a walk through hell ; feed your dome then watch your eyeballs swell ; guide you out of triple stage darkness ; when it get dark again then i am a spark this ; microphone because the heat is on you see smoke ; and i am finished when the beat is gone i am no joke ; verse one ; turn up the bass check out my melody hand out a cigar ; i am letting knowledge be born and my name is the r ; rakim not like the rest of them i am not on a list ; that is what i am saying i drop science like a scientist ; my melody is in a code the very next episodes ; has the mic often distorting ready to explode ; i keep the mic in fahrenheit freeze mc is and make me colder ; the listened is system is kicking like solar ; as i memorize advertise like a moet ; keep you going when i am flowing smooth enough you know it ; but rough that is why the middle of my story i tell be ; verse two ; so what if i am a microphone fiend addicted soon as i sing ; one of these for mc is so they do not have to scream ; i could not wait to take the mic flow into it to test ; then let my melody play and then the record suggest ; that i am dropping bombs but i stay peace and calm ; any mc that disagree with me just have your arm ; and i will break when i am through breaking i will leave you broke ; drop the mic when i am finished and watch it smoke ; so stand back you wanna rap all of that can wait ; i will not push i will not beat around the bush ; i wanna break upon those who are not supposed to ; you might try but you can not get close to ; because i am number one competition is none ; i am measures with the heat that is made by sun ; whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall ; i just writing my name in graffiti on the wall ; you should not have told me you said you control me ; so now a contest is what you owe me ; pull out your money pull out your cut ; pull up a chain and i am a tear shit up ; so easily will i emcee ; some bass and treble is most scratching and cutting a voice ; and when it is mine that is when the rhyme is always choice ; i would not have came to set my name around the same weak shit ; putting blues and slugs and words that do not fit ; in a rhyme why waste time on the microphone ; i take this more serious than just a poem ; rockin party to party backyard to yard ; now tear it up you all and bless the mic for the god ; verse three ; the rhyme is rugged at the same time sharp ; i can swing off anything even a string of a hard ; just turn it on and start rockin mind no introduction ; til i finish dropping science no interruption ; when i approach i exercise like a couch ; sin a melody and and numerous notes ; with the mic and the rakim ; it is a task like a match i will strike again ; rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped ; put in older to pursue with the momentum except ; i say one rhyme and i older a longer rhyme shorter ; a pause but do not stop the tape recorder ; verse four ; i am not a regular competitor first rhyme editor ; melody arrange moet etcetera ; extra event the grand final like bonus ; i am the man they call the microphonist ; with wisdom which means wise words been spoken ; too many at one time watch the mic start smoking ; i came to express the rap i manifest ; stand in my way and i will lead a words protect ; mc is that wanna be dissed they are gonna ; be dissed if they do not get from in front ; all they can go get is me a glass of moet ; a hard time sip your juice and watch a smooth moet ; i take i mc is put me in a like ; and and i more brothers who think they can rhyme ; well it will take i more before i go for mine ; and that is i mc is ate up at the same time ; easy does it do it easy that is what i am down ; no fessing no messing around no chewing ; no robbing no buying biting why bother ; this slow will stop trying fighting to follow ; my unusual style will confused you a while ; if i was water i flow in the nile ; so many rhymes you will not have time to go for your is ; just because of a because i have to pause ; right after tonight is when i prepare ; to catch another suck duck mc out there ; cops my strategy has to be tragedy catastrophe ; and after this you will call me your majesty ; my melody ; verse five ; marley mail synthesized it i memorize it ; eric b made a cut and advertised it ; my melody is created for mc is in the place ; who try to listen cops i am dissing ; take off your necklace you try to detect my pace ; now you are bugging over off my rhyme like bass ; the melody that i am styling smooth as a violin ; rough enough to break new york from long island ; my wisdom is shift no matter if ; my momentum is slow mc is still stand stuff ; i am genuine like leather do not try to be clever ; so eric b cut it easily ; it is been a long time i should not have left you ; without a strong rhyme to step to ; think of how many weak shows you slept through ; time is up i am sorry i kept you ; thinking of this you keep repeating you miss ; the rhymes from the microphone soloist ; and you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon ; as you hear it pump up the volume ; dance wit the speaker untill you hear it blow ; then plug in the headphone because here it go ; it is a i letter word when it is heard it control ; your body to dance you got it soul ; detects the tempo like a red alert ; roaches your reflex so let it work ; when this is playing you can not get stuck wit ; the steps so get set and i am a still come up wit ; a gift to be shift follow the leader the rhyme will go ; def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago ; it can be done but only i can do it ; for those that can dance and clip your hands to it ; i start to think and then i sink ; into the paper like i was in ; when i am writing i am trapped in between the lines ; i escape when i finish the rhyme ; i got soul ; you got it x ; i know you got soul ; picture a mic the stage is empty ; a beat like this might tempt me ; to pose show my rings and my fat gold chain ; grab the mic like i am on soul train ; but i will wait because i mastered this ; let the others go first so the brothers do not miss ; eric b break the stick you got it ; rakim will begin when you make the mix ; i will experiment like a scientist ; you wanna rhyme you gotta sign my list ; because i am a manifest and bless the mic i hold ; you want it next then you gotta have soul ; because if you is not got it i am a make an encore ; take the mic make the people respond for ; the r because that is the way it will have to be ; if you wanna get on after me ; think about it wait erase your rhyme ; forget it and do not waste your time ; because i will be in the crowd if you is not controlling it ; drop the mic you should not be holding it ; this is how it should be done ; this style is identical to none ; some try to make it sound like this but you are getting me ; so upset that i am wet because you are sweating me ; i drop steam like a microphone fiend ; pager to mc is my theme ; i get hype when i hear a drum roll ; rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul ; you got it x ; i got soul you got it that is why i came ; to teach those who can not say my name ; first of all i am the soloist the soul controller ; rakim gets stronger as i get older ; constant elevation because expansion ; i write my rhyme while i cool in my mansion ; then put it on tape and in the city i test it ; then on the radio the r is requested ; you listen to it the concept might break you ; because almost anyone can relate to ; whoever is out of hand i am give him handles ; light them up blow them out like candles ; or should i just let him meet ; then give him a hand so they can see how it felt ; i am not bold just because i rock gold ; rakim is on the mic and you know i got soul ; you got it x ; now i am a stop to see what you got ; get off the mic before i get too hot ; i want to see which posse can dance the best ; it should be easy because the beat is fresh ; now if your from uptown brooklyn bound ; the bronx queens or long island sound ; even other states come right and exact ; it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; since you came here you have to show and prove ; and do that dance until it do not move ; because all you need is soul selfesteem will release ; the rest is up to you rakim i will say peace ; you got it sex ; verse one ; standing by the speaker suddenly i had this ; fever was it me or either summer madness ; because i just can not stand around ; so i get closer and the closer i get the better it sound ; my mind starts to activate rhymes collaborate ; because when i heard the beat i just had to make ; something from the top of my head ; so i fell into the groove of the wax and i said ; how could i move the crowd ; first of all is not no mistakes allowed ; here is the instruction put it together ; it simple is not it but quite clever ; some of you been trying to write rhymes for years ; but weak idea irritate my ears ; is this the best that you can make ; because if not and you got more i will wait ; but do not make me wait too long because i am a move on ; the dancefloor when they put something smooth on ; so turn up the bass it is better when it is loud ; because i like to move the crowd ; move the crowd ; verse two ; imagine me wit the heat that is made by solar ; it gets stronger everytime i hold a ; microphone check the tone to get started ; the like for the microphone is departed ; so leave it up to me my dj is mixing ; everyone is moving or pager to listen ; your hands in the air your mouth shut ; because i am on the mic and eric b is on the cut ; for those that know me indeed i like to flow ; especially when the music is going slow ; it gives me a chance to let everybody know ; it is time to bust out the rakim show ; i am the intelligent wise on the mic i will rise ; right in front of your eyes because i am a surprise ; so i am a let my knowledge be born to a perfection ; all raise due to allah and that is a blessing ; wit knowledge of self there is nothing i can not solve ; at thirty degrees i revolve ; this is actual fact it is not an act it is been proven ; indeed and i proceed to make the crowd keep moving ; move the crowd ; yo rakim what is up ; yo i am doing the knowledge e i am trying to get paid in full ; well check this out since nobry walters is our agency right ; true ; karma lewis is our agent ; word up ; zakia the broadway is our record company ; indeed ; okay so who we rolling with ; we rolling with rush ; of rushtown management check this out since we talking over ; this def beat that i put together i wanna hear some of them ; def rhymes know what i am saying and together we can get ; paid in full ; thinking of a master plan ; because is not nothing but sweat inside my hand ; so i dig into my pocket all my money is spent ; so i dig deeper but still coming up with list ; so i start my mission leave my residence ; thinking how could i get some dead presidents ; i need money i used to be a stickup kid ; so i think of all the devious things i did ; i used to roll up this is a hold up is not nothing funny ; stop smiling be still do not nothing move but the money ; but now i learned to earn cops i am righteous ; i feel great so maybe i might just ; search for a i to i if i strive ; then maybe i will stay alive ; so i walk up the street whistling this ; feeling out of place cops man do i miss ; a pen and a paper a stereo a tape of ; me and eric b and a nice big plate of ; fish which is my favorite wish ; but without no money it is still a wish ; cops i do not like to dream about getting paid ; so i dig into the books of the rhymes that i made ; to now test to see if i got pull ; hit the studio cops i am paid in full ; knowledge will begin until i finish this song ; 'bebecause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on ; you sweat as you step about to get hype ; or should you just listen to the man on the mic ; you are physically in this with me but how could you tell ; if it is meant to be hiphop if you are not mentally as well ; ready to absorb the rhyme that i just poured ; into the mic and so unite and this will not be so bored ; if you just keep kicking listen to the mix ; and think you will sink into the rhyme like quicksand ; holds and controls you until i leave ; you fall deeper in the style it is hard to breathe ; the only time i stop is when somebody drop and then ; bring them to the front 'bebecause my rhyme is i the oxygen ; then have your hands when you are ready i will send you ; into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue ; and so on and i am a go on simultaneously ; and even if i stop the rhyme remains to be ; rising to the top and i came to drop it ; catch it and quit it is my topic ; universual 'bebecause i move everybody to come ; by exercising your mind you will coincide as one ; you look around and see how packed the party starts to get ; i draw a crowd like an architect ; the five boroughs react and all the island attract ; and every state can not wait so they attack ; off a spot on the floor squeeze in because it is packed ; it will be more room if mc is play the back ; i am the r the a to the him ; if i was not then why would i say i am ; the microphone fiend if i was a fake ; whoever said it is just bugging off the rhymes i make ; i had you biting your tongue for what i bring and recite ; sung it on stage some said it do not sound like ; the voice on the record i see what you mean ; because the system was wack so i had to scream ; so just give me a mic if it is loud i will blow it ; if not into the crowd i will throw it ; pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well ; before i let go i am a spark your brain cell ; i took time to write tonight i will recite ; so poetically inclined when the mic is held tight ; rhymes start flowing kisses are blowing ; mc is are knowing that is why they are going ; home to tell a friend when the party ends ; because mic by mic and stage by stage ; tape by tape and page by page ; when the crowd is moving i complete with the mix ; the rougher the cuts the rougher the rhyme gets ; deeper and deeper i hope you understand it ; i made it up myself and i planned it ; for other mc is who waste time ; writing jokes riddles and maybe a rhyme ; i cross my arms and i was waiting but i was hating ; the rappers on the microphone was fronting just faking ; they was not breaking which means i was acting ; to get up on the microphone and then start taking ; control of the mic uptight when i grabbed it ; so thug the speaker your ear is a magnet ; attracted to a freestyle put in effect ; you listen to my man while you are sipping moet ; so eric pick up the needle yeah put it in the middle aight ; give me a scratch turn my mic up a little ; i want you to hear this perfectly clear ; catch what i am saying you get the idea ; i hope you knowledge the beginning because i am finished this song ; the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on ; i came in the door i said it before ; i never let the mic magnatize me no more ; but it is biting me fighting me inviting me to rhyme ; i can not hold it back i am looking for the like ; taking off my coat clearing my throat ; my rhyme will be kicking it until i hit my last not ; my mind will range to find all kinds of idea ; selfesteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build ; but still say a rhyme after the next one ; prepared never scared i will just bless one ; and you know that i am the soloist ; so eric b make them clip to this ; i do not but out or chill or be acting ill ; no tricks in '86 it is time to build ; eric b easy on the cut no mistakes allowed ; because to me mc means move the crowd ; i made it easy to dance to this ; but can you detect what is coming next from the flex of the wrist ; saying indeed that i precede because my man made a mix ; if he bleed he will not need no bandaid to fix ; if they can get some around until there is no rhymes left ; i hurry up because the cut will make them bleed to death ; but he is kicking it because it is not no half stepping ; the party is live the rhyme can not be kept in ; side it needs erupting just like a volcano ; it is not the everyday style of the same old rhyme ; because i am better then the rest of them ; eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim ; go get a girl and get soft and warm ; do not get excited you have been invited to a quiet storm ; but now it is out of hand because you told me you hate me ; and then you ask what have i done lately ; first you said all you want is love and affection ; let me be your angel and i will be your protection ; take you out buy you all kinds of things ; i must of got you too hot and burned off your wings ; you caught an attitude you need food to eat up ; i am scheming like i am dreaming on a couch wit my feet up ; you scream i am lay you must be crazy ; thought i was a donut you tried to blaze me ; funky ; verse one ; ; follow me into a solo ; get in the flow and you can picture like a photos ; music mixed mellow maintains to make ; melodies for mc is motivate the breaks ; i am everlasting i can go on for days and days ; with rhyme displays that engrave deep as xrays ; i can take a phase that is rarely heard flip it ; now it is a daily word ; i can get iller than a killing bomb ; but no alarm rakim will remain calm ; selfesteem make me super super and supreme ; but for a microphone still i fiend ; this was a tape i was not supposed to break ; i was supposed to wait but let us motivate ; i want to see who can keep followin and swallowing ; taking the making biting it and borrowing ; brothers tried and others died to get the formula ; but i am a let ya sweat you still is not warm ; you a step away from frozen stuff as if ya posing ; dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen ; so follow me and were ya thinking you were first ; let us travel at magnificent speeds around the universe ; what could ya say as the earth gets further and further away ; planet are small as balls of play ; astral into the milk way world is outasight ; far as the eye can see not even a satellite ; now stop and turn around and look ; as ya stare in the darkness ya knowledge is took ; so keep staring soon ya suddenly see a star ; you better follow it because it is the r ; this is a lesson if ya guessing and if ya borrowing ; hurry hurry step right up and keep followin ; the leader ; ; verse two ; ; this is a lifetime mission vision of prison ; aight listen ; in this journey you are the journal i am the journalist ; am i eternal or an eternalist ; i am about to flow long as i can possibly go ; keep ya moving because the crowd said so ; dance cuts rip ya wants ; eric b on the blades bleeding to death call the ambulance ; pull out my weapon and start to squeeze ; a magnum as a microphone murdering mc is ; let us quite a rhyme from a record i wrote ; follow the leader yeah dope ; because everytime i stop it seems ya stuck ; soon as ya try to step off ya selfdestruct ; i came to overcome before i am gone ; by showing and proven and letting knowledge be born ; then after that i will live forever you disagree ; you say never then follow me ; from century to century you will remember me ; in history not a mystery or a memory ; god by nature mind raised in asia ; since you was bricked i have to raise ya ; from the cradle to the grave but remember ; you are not a slave ; because we was put here to be much more than that ; but we could not see it because our mind was trapped ; but i am here to break away the chains take away the pain ; remake the brains reveals my name ; i guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous ; it can not be mixed diluted it can not be changed or switched ; here is a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing ; hurry hurry step right up and keep following ; the leader ; ; verse three ; ; a furified freestyle lyrics of fury ; my third eye makes me shine like jewelry ; you are just a rentarapper your rhymes are minutemaid ; i will be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade ; i can not wait to break and eliminate ; on every traitor or snake so stay awake ; and follow and follow because the tempo is a trail ; the stage is a cage the mic is a third jail ; i am rakim the fiend of a microphone ; i am not him so leave my mic alone ; soon as the beat is felt i am ready to go ; so faster your seatbelt because i am about to flow ; no need to speed slow down to let the leader lead ; word to daddy indeed ; the r is a rolling stone so i am rolling ; directions is told then the rhymes are stolen ; stop bugging a brother said dig me i never dug them ; he could not follow the leader long enough so i drug them ; into danger zone he should arrange his own ; face it it is basic erase it change ya tone ; there is one r in the alphabet ; it is a oneletter word and it is about to get ; more complex from one rhyme to the next ; eric b be easy on the flex ; i have been from state to state followers tailgate ; keep coming but you came too late but i will wait ; so back up regroup get a grip come equipped ; you are the next contestent clip ya hands you won a trip ; the price is right do not make a deal too soon ; how many notes could you name this tone ; follow the leader is the title theme task ; now ya know you do not have to ask ; rap is rhythm and poetry cuts create sound effects ; you might catch up if you follow the records e wreck ; until then keep eating and swallowing ; you better take a deep breath and keep followin ; the leader ; i was a fiend before i became a teen ; i melted microphone instead of ones of ice cream ; music orientated so when hiphop was originated ; fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated ; they tried to take it and say that i am too small ; cool because i do not get upset ; i kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then i jet ; back to the la without a mic to grab ; so then i and all the rhymes i had ; one after the other one then i make another one ; to is the opposite then ask if the brother is done ; i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine ; but i do not need a cigarette know what i mean ; i am paging ripping up the stage and ; do not it sound amazing because every rhyme is made and ; thought of because it is sort fan addiction ; magnatized by the mixing ; vocal vocabulary your verse you are stuck in ; the mic is a drano volcanoes erupting ; rhymes overflowing gradually growing ; everything is written in the cold so it can chin ; ride my thoughts to guide ; i tracks to slide ; the invincible microphone fiend rakim ; spread the word because i am in ; effect ; a smooth operated operating correctly ; but back to the problem i gotta habit ; you can not solve it silly rabbit ; the prescription is a hypertone that is thorough when ; i fiend for a microphone like heroin ; soon as the bass kicks i need a fix ; gimme a stage and a mic and a mix ; and i will put you in a good or is it a state of ; unawareness beware it is the reanamator ; a menace to a microphone a lethal weapon ; an assasinator if the people is not stepping ; you see a part of me that you never seen ; when i am fiending for a microphone i am the microphone fiend ; verse i ; after i i am worse that a gremlin ; feed me hiphop and i start trembling ; the thrill of suspense is intense your horrified ; by any means neccesary this is what has to be done ; make way because here i come ; my dj cuts material ; grand imperial ; it is a must that i bust any mic you are hand to me ; it is inherited it is runs in the family ; i wrote the rhyme that broke the bull is back ; if that do not slow them up i carry a full pack ; now i do not want to have to let off you should of kept off ; you did not keep the stage warm step off ; ladies and gentleman you are about to see ; a pasttime hobby about to be ; take it to the maximum i can not relax see i am ; hype as a hyperchrondriac because the rap be one ; hell of a antidote something you can not smoke ; more than dope you are trying to move away but you can not you are broke ; more than cracker up you should have backed up ; for those who act up need to be more than smacked up ; any entertainer i got a torture chamber ; one on one and i am the remainder ; so close your eyes and hold your breath ; and i am a hit ya wit the blow of death ; before you go you will remember you seen ; the fiend of a microphone i am the microphone fiend ; verse one ; poets are paranoid dj is destroyed ; because i came back to attack others in spit ; strike like lightning it is quite frightening ; but do not be afraid in the dark in a park ; not a scream or a cry or a back more like a spark ; ya treble like a alcoholic muscles tighter up ; what is that lighten up you see a sight but ; suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick ; you grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick ; music is the clue when i come your warned ; apocolypse now when i am done ya gone ; have not you ever heard of a murderer ; this is the death penaltyand i am serving a ; death wish so come on step to this ; hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist ; friday the thirteenth walking down elm street ; you come in my real ya get beat ; this is off limit so your visions are blurry ; all ya see is the meters at a volume ; pumping lyrics of fury ; it is a fearified freestyle ; terror in the styles never errorfiles ; indeed i am known your exiled ; for those that opposed to be level or next to this ; i is not a devil and this is not the exorcist ; worse than a nightmare you do not have to sleep a wink ; the pain is a migraine every time ya think ; flashbacks intervene ya start to hear ; the rakim in your ear ; then the beat is hysterical ; that makes eric go get a a and cops the wack ; soon the lyrical format is superior ; faces of death remain ; mc is decaying because they never stayed ; the scene of a crime every night at the show ; the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know ; it is only one capable breaks the unbreakable ; melodiesunmakable patternunecscapable ; a horn if want the style i posse ; i bless the child the earth the god and bomb the rest ; for those that envy a mc it can be ; hazardous to your health so be friendly ; a matter of life and death just like a ethchasketch ; shake untill your clear make it disappear make the next ; after the ceremony let the rhyme rest in peace ; if not my soul will release ; the scene is recreated reincarnated updated i am glad you made it ; because your about to see a disasterous sight ; a performance never again performed on a mic ; lyrics of fury ; a fearified freestyle ; make sure the system is loud when i mention ; phrases that is fearsome ; you want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums ; i sit back and observe the whole scenery ; then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me ; strictly business i am quickly in this good ; and i do not care if the whole crowd is a witness ; i am a tear you apart but i am a spare you a heart ; program into the speed of the rhyme prepare to start ; rhythm is out of the radius insane as the craziest ; musical madness mc ever made see it is ; now an emergency openheart surgery ; open your mind you will find every word will be ; furier than ever i remain the future ; battle is temptingwhatever suits ya ; for words the sentence there is no resemblance ; you think you are suffer then suffer the consequences ; i am never dyingterrifying results ; i wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts ; mictomouth resuscitation rhythm with radiation ; novicane ease the pain it might save him ; if not eric b is the judge the crowd is the jury ; how do i lead to homicide ; lyrics of fury ; they are getting furier a fearified freestyle ; put your hands together clip your hands ; verse one rakim ; this is for thousands of people who came ; a show from road to road you are entertainer ; i do not even have to say my name ; because when the place is ripped in half i am to blame ; masses of posse packed up scheming ; ladies lovely and keep on screaming ; go rakim go rakim go ; it will not be long then it is on with the show ; i am late so hit the brakes and park the benzito ; double oh seven incognito ; sneak in the back door looking for the stage ; when i get on you react in a rage ; people from side to side and front to back ; will not dance if the mc is wack ; the crowd go psycho even if i do not move ; some like the groove because i am so smooth ; then something happens feet start tapping ; you can not hold back when rakim is rapping ; the man you have been waiting for rougher than ever ; ladies and gentlemen put your hands together ; clip your hands ; verse two rakim ; i create me take me shake me then make me clip to this ; most of you rappers can not even rap to this ; i made it faster you tried to master ; syncopated styles words flowing after ; measures of metaphor definitions of more than one ; take it both ways i will be here when you are done ; remember as the rhyme goes on it is rougher ; soon as i stop you had enough of ; followin footsteps you better turn back soon ; sucker mc is suck rhymes like vacuums ; the style remains the same the words is changed ; bitten rewritten recite and rearranged ; sing along if your tongue is strong it gets some ; sing when i am gone and it will break your jaw ; wisdom flows so shift i am asiatic ; is it a gift or automatic ; static i do not fling ; i got a tip of my own and i do not sing ; do not understand here is an example ; and why mc is and dj is sample ; because we do not have a band it is just my voice and his hands ; that is what hiphop was it still stands ; the records we use are from mom is and pop is collection ; find a break from a dope election ; and go to the store then buy one more ; so my dj can mix because that is what his hands are for ; years later hiphop got contracts ; the chance to put actual facts on wax ; a mind is the couch the physical for is the team ; the top is the destination i am the cream ; and still i rise with something pumping and something clever ; ladies and gentlemen put your hands together ; clip your hands clip me clip me ; verse three rakim ; now who is the man with the masterplan ; with stacks of verbal attack so clip your hands ; rhyme written in graffiti xerox on blueprints ; students influenced are now a nuisance ; you could not fight it you had to clip to this ; you got excited you almost snapped your wrist ; the rhymes was written for the crowd is enjoyment ; when i am with this you can not toy with ; the def jam juice rough rhyme produce ; loads of lyrics get you loose then loose ; the man so smooth and world so rough ; eric is throwing and sewn ripping restitchin the cuts ; microphone your majesty no one is bad as me ; seems the tragedy rakim had to be ; thinking of some def view of a video ; visions are vicious and i will let the city know ; whoever is fronting they know nothing to say though ; so lay low musical forms are kicking like kato ; do not get near it hard as you ever hear it ; i know it is fearified but do not fear it ; and try to predict which rhyme you can kick ; you are quick to pick your best for the mic is lit ; instead of going with the flow like you are supposed to go ; and enjoy the show and yo put your hands together ; clip your hands put your hands together ; clip your hands ; it is to the listeners whispered x ; it is to the listened ; repeat interlude and like x ; it is to the listeners for those that have a ear for this ; state of the art engineered for the mix ; eardrums are playing along to what i am saying you are singing a song ; stevie blast on the keyboard swinging along ; but you do not have to dance play it cool and listen ; my dj is mixing and i will do the quizzin ; because who is number one if not best then better ; here is a hit the with letter ; the rhymes is sportable microphone is portable ; for any immortal man words is not affordable ; never take a lost because i am hard to beat ; i is not cheap but do not sell me a dream i do not sleep ; i am paid in full so save the bull ; this is not a stickup you do not have to have until ; you feel sure and you want more then wipe your sweat ; because i just wanted to see how hype you could get ; because when i came in the door stepping hard enough to shake the floor ; i just started but the others can not make no more ; running out of beats breaks and out of time ; if i was gone you would be running out of rhymes ; i prove records do not have to be long ; if it is understood and the story is strong ; you can speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners ; the people is peep less it is to the listeners ; i am the lord for something you can absorb ; try and control and be cautious but the cuts and the chorus ; make me deeper than down i make the crowd crowd around ; people are peep less because the soloist found ; phrases thoughts made by the r of course ; one thing i do is keep me different and far from yours ; you keep talking when will all the damage be done ; you say you are ruling but when i am in the place you do not come ; maybe you are waiting to see what i am making ; one more style gets taken then i am a be breaking ; if the patterns are because piano is soft ; but make it hard for you to start where i left off ; you find yourself lost til the point is across ; you hit reverse to rewind it that is when you hit the pause ; i set the scene first you hear mixing ; then the microphone fiend is in effect still listening ; pay close attention never before mentioned ; listen up i got a brand new intention ; made from a musician it is notes are played crips ; but listeners listen to what i wrote on a diss ; copywritten but still bitten they almost sound like ; almost pumping but it is not down like ; a record is supposed to sound watch as it go around ; records are broken smashed into the ground ; that is not my melody brothers keep running up and telling me ; others are trying to flow smooth and steadily ; potholes are left in my path then i crash and cruise ; whoever refuse and cruise right past me ; because i just left to do it for easy whatever ; death till i get back you better stay in step ; at the speakers you will stare if i was there your description is ; no competition ; ; no competition ; ; competition is none i remain at the top like the sun ; and i burn whoever come in the chambers of torture ; i caught ya you should have brought ya ; neighborhood to support ya ; no one in my path will withstand ; under pressure the wrath of a shift man ; you name the day the grounds to be neutral ; speak your piece the feeling is mutual ; we can go topic from topic whenever i drop it ; try to stop it ; in other words what the brother heard ; he tried to catch it but what occurred ; was too much weight for one brain to take ; try to concentrate maintain then elevated ; program an ounce from pound to pound ; the matter of weight can not hold my mind down ; permanent damage i do away with ; no time for fun because i do not play with ; competitors there is only one when i am done ; competition is none ; ; no competition ; ; competition is none i am the soul survivor ; mc is get live but i get liver ; it is not a memories live in concept ; at every network the r the expert ; whoever goes against because friction ; introduction music where is the mixing ; a will never die fools they never try ; to beat or defeat me because whenever i ; put poetry in motion ; from the nile then out into the ocean ; threefourths of water makes seven seat ; a third of land threesixty degrees ; i circulate and remain to rotate ; seven days a week at a quake or a slow rate ; be prepared whenever i come ; competition is none ; ; it is no competition ; ; creator the alphabets let us communicate ; when i translate the situation is straight ; no dictionary is necessary to use ; big words do nothing but confused and lose ; from the first step a concept was kept ; to the end of the rhyme it get more indepth ; all thoughts i come across my mind is the source ; made by the r of course ; seven holes in my face as i am looking out my window ; speak with the beat and it seem like the wind blows ; through the speakers i hear it so pump this ; and we can fill up the whole circumfrence ; with competition on an impossible mission ; coming up with nothing keep fishing ; no runners up just lost or forfeits ; they all get butterflies soon as the dog gets ; unlocked lines for blocks and blocks ; might be trifling to call the cops ; bring along paramedics ; but that will not help you not even calisthetics ; i am god g is the seventh letter made ; raining on rappers there is no parade ; so if you is not wise then do not even come ; competition for this enter mixing is none ; ; it is no competition ; ; competition is none ; whoever underestimated still wanted ; pumping the radio finally they played it ; you wondered how come the album was late ; i was giving you time to get the last one straight ; the show must go on i got something to dance to ; slow it down and romance to and give me a chance to ; keep you in tone and up to part ; then you are doing it with the r ; doing it wit the r ; something new and to keep you doing what ya doing ; this is for you and your crew and for who in ; the vicinity i do not need no identity ; i see hands in the air that means many be ; cooperating i can not stop relating ; hiphop is making more sense when i am staring ; paragraphs of potential to prevent you ; from using my instrumental keep in mind i meant to ; illustrate another iller break immediately ; hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me ; then soon you are in tone and up to part ; and then you are doing it wit the r ; keep doing it you keep doing it wit the r ; in the summertime pockets bulging ; somethings is happening then i am indulging ; music is mine gucci seats reclined ; gold drill a paint job will shine ; pull up in the park and then pop the drunk ; turn up the bass and let the system thump ; a block party starts to for people start to warm ; loud as a ghetto blaster word is bond ; records remind you of a madness ; the moment it is played you get gladdest ; the return of the brother keeping you up to part ; and you are doing it wit the r ; shout outs ; how could i keep my composure ; when all sort of thoughts fought for exposure ; release then veins in the brains increase ; when i let off make a wish and blow the smoke off my piece ; unloading unfold and the rhymes are exploding ; and the mic that i holding golden ; cordless because the fire caught fire like a use ; gunpowder and the slightest cruise is a friction ; the outcome is there so listen ; here is the grief description ; a boom then flame then smoke asses a dust to dust ; contact is compact when i bust ; mc is are now in a massacre ; a disaster a master at fashion a beat to death ; to a pull till it can not pump ; speakers paint saying nothing ; now the ball can thump ; as i am looking i stand like great buildings in brooklyn ; then the stage is took then ; havoc struck that could product a whole court ; keep in touch with the mic when you are holding you all ; sumping and pumping and slobbin and drooling ; nothing is pumping who do you think ya fooling ; tommy tucker the neighborhood sucker ; what you oughta do is pick up a tempo ; from what i invest so hard not to bite but you can not prevent so ; you start to kidnap ; i watch the kid rap ; when he get off he know he should not a did that ; minor oldtimer weakrhymer stayinliner ; you will not be inclined to go so yo ; maybe later you are gonna be ; but for now you are almost one of me ; now the immature imitations taken from originations ; made by train and a little arranging ; so perform if ya still paint warm maybe after ; a roast by the host with the most it is a musical massacre ; never tired do not even try it keep quiet ; like a storm you could rainbut a riot ; remains the gangs power just like the towerin inferno ; the beat is gonna burn so ; distance i kept ou better watch your step ; volunteers go from here and get ; ya out of the flames ; appreciate the temperature change ; anywhere within the range of celcius ; fahrenheit on the mic mic belts see it ; burn soon as it is felt see it is torching scorching ; mic is piping hot steaming who is scheming now ya not ; games brown must a been busted ; disgusted now he can not be trusted ; embalmed with fluid ; static can because an explosion in fact impact is closing in ; time was up so i do not need a time bomb ; beat gives me a heatstroke when i rhyme calm ; pull out the too sometimes i wanna break fool ; but i was cool like one in the chamber ; let us play a game of rhyming roulette ; and put me up to your brain and name a rhyme about ya cloud ; one mistake ya out ; if this imitation it can not be the same show ; maybe what you will find somewhere over the rainbow ; courage heart brain you need rhyme ; turn on your mic snap your fingers three times ; we gone or the story will not end the same ; and you will feel the flame ; the potion was weak make another antidote ; whats the science why can not ya quite ; elements for musical intelligence ; rhymes are irrelevant no development ; and that settle it ; go manufacture a match send me after a blast ; let the rhythm hit them ; i am the arsenal ; i got artillery lyrics of ammo ; rounds of rhythm ; then i am a give them piano ; bring a bulletproof vest ; nothing to ricochet ; ready to aim at the brain ; now what the trigger say ; tempo trifling ; felt like a rifle ; message and melodies ; might go right through ; simultaneously like an uzi ; nothing can cruise me ; lyrics let up when lady say do not lose me ; so reload quickly ; and you better hit me ; while i am letting this fifi get wit me ; you stepping with i i i ; better make it snappy ; no time to do your hair baby ; brothers are busting at me ; beats and bullet us pass me ; none on target ; they want the r hit ; but watch the god get ; quicker the tongue is the trigger ; because i am real fast ; let off some rhythm at them ; let them feel the blast ; penetrate at a crazy rate ; this is not no i ; hit them at point blank range ; and watch them radiate ; running out of ammunition ; i am done with me ; you ask me how i did them ; i let the rhythm hit them ; i push a power that is punishable ; better be a prisoner ; the hit man is the ; brother with charisma ; showing you that i have ; powerful paragraphs ; followers will become leaders ; but without a path ; ya mentally paralyzed ; crippled ya third eye ; rhymes are blurred ; then it occurred that you heard i ; reduced the friction with crucifixion ; let loose the mix then ; boost the pistol ; eric hit them with some of that ; cut like a lumberjack ; and me getting hit back ; it will not be none of that ; i am untouchable ; you see me in d ; when i let the rhythm hit another mc ; lyrics made of lead ; enter your head ; then eruptions of a mass production ; will spread when ; music is louder ; full of gunpower ; microphone machinery ; when i see a crowd of ; party people pumping ; their fist like this ; ya hide in the back ; thinking that i might miss ; but the r is accurate ; plus i am packed up with ; educated punch lines that ; i have to hit ; whatever i aim at ; i like them up ; ya body is weak feel with pain ; that time is up ; you been hit with something ; different is not it ; rakim is gonna radiate and nothing is equivalent ; nothing can harm me ; why try to bar me ; you could not come around to rob with a army ; you will get wrecked by the architect ; so respect them ; i disconnect them soon as i inject them ; with radiation ; put them by the basement ; bust his chest open ; bash his face in ; let it split him ; since he brought his main man with him ; he ask me how i did him ; i let the rhythm hit him ; let it hit him ; dance floor is dangerous ; packed in like a briefcase ; rhythm with real rough rhyme ; beats with deep bass ; girls with tight wants ; maybe they might dance ; tonight if the is on the mike ; there is a slight chance ; the crowd is crucial ; mc is grounds are neutral ; now that you are here let me introduce you ; get ready ; i am hard read like graffiti but steady ; science i drop is real heavy ; radiant energy that will be the penals ; touch the third jail on the pain of remedy ; the prescription is one every hour ; now it is a havoc ; if ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatics ; attention follow directions real close ; keep out of reach of children ; beware of overdose ; too many milligram ; but what made a iller jam ; my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts ; that kill a man ; i dead for the ear to fear ; might split him ; he will never forget him ; he will rest in peace with them ; at least when he left he will know what hit him ; the last breath of the words of death ; was the rhythm ; now throw you hands in the air and yo go ; rakim will do the rest of this slow ; if i speed they know you will blow the hell up ; if i slow up catch up hell no ; wicked as i kicked it ; do not need to remi it ; because i prefixed it ; reversed and switched it ; to perform to perfection ; section for section ; rhymes keep connecting ; ya guessing what is expand ; blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it ; ya hit the ground burning and woke up frostbitten ; because when i explained ya can not complain for pain ; travel through the brain hit a vein ; then remain let it radiate ; vibes will vibrate ; why did you violated ; now i am a have to let the style break ; means now the tone is ingrown ; after this here is thrown gimme another microphone ; before i get that fifi i met ; whisper i wanna reach your intellect ; kiss her because i wanna give her the most respect ; so i shine and let the write reflect ; hold her mold her make her feel older ; lay her on my shoulder ; everything i told her ; makes her feel secure whenever i am with her ; and you know how i did her ; me and the rhythm hit her ; i am the alpha with no omega ; beginning without the end so play the ; eye inside no extended version ; next episodes be smooth as a persian ; rhyme everlasting there will be no part two ; knowledge is infinite once i start to draw ; a better picture for your third eye if you are blind ; you know with a mic i am a black michaelangelo ; i am the brother who idea are colorful ; giving me insight but giving me trouble to ; comprehend because they thoughts will not blind in ; they are pretending while i am extending ; you bite like a parasite you attack ; but you will not strike because you is not no match ; you need more light because yours got dim ; then you get sparked by the lord rakim ; what is the matter g check your battery ; go get charged up then come battle me ; you try hard and die hard you is not eveready ; when they check the purse you will be dead as freddie ; shop in years for new idea ; check your engine and ask your engineers ; to equalize try to disguise it ; if that do not work yo then monosize it ; you need more power better bring battlecat ; but this is not grayskull and you is not ripping jack ; do not drop the mic and jet for your tooley ; we can go rhyme for rhyme til the mic stop the working ; then i am a leave you behind the iron certain ; and you will remain backstage ; your book is over i ripped your last page ; changed the ending at least you went out rapping ; now i am a tell me what happened ; i filled the mic with explosives and lit it up ; it was too heavy to hold he could not pick it up ; pass the mic let him try to get paid ; he hit the stage it went off like a hand grenade ; now scrap him off the floor and off my list ; i is not a soloist i am an arsonist ; sprayed up he said he was gonna do what ; played up mc grand but poohbutt ; stole his lady and drove her crazy ; you asked me why because her man tried to play me ; i sent her back a nervous wreck ; and tried to put her back in check ; my speciality is mastering the female species ; i specialize in her until she sees ; where i come from and why i came ; i time the train til she manifest my name ; fill her with life until she burst with energy ; then leave her restless because a lot of women be ; trying to brain us and leave us strapped dry ; put holes in our pocket but you is not that fly ; i slipped your wings and bring you down to earth ; and tell you what life is worth ; it is not rings and things that is materialistic ; you wanna hip on imperialist with ; food for thought because i am the shelter ; i will be your clothes keep you warm and help ya ; not to be hot to rot by a hunt ; and why do you all got to flaunt ; cool i heat you up like a black mind coat ; thug your neck like a fat gold rope ; words i speak and my dj is cuts will warm ya ears ; like mind earmuffs ; so eric show me how fast your hand'sll go ; so the people in the stands will know ; that you do not scratch your cuts in the grave ; moves in waves to my rhyme displays ; float evoke my tempo jets ; expressions express when you kick steps ; keep me energetic so let it ; pound in your head til what i said is embedded ; do not forget it is copastetic set it ; anywhere you want your poetry is pathetic ; you gets no credit til you get it straight ; let us motivate ; no intermissions because it is not commercial ; if you wanna break then i will reimburse you ; i will not let go so my mic will not drop because ; vocab is endless vocal exist ; rhyme goes on so no one can stop this ; especially when i start to say the ; rhymes with no omega ; no omega ; planet earth was my place of birth ; born to be the soul controller of the universe ; besides the part of the map i hit first ; any environment i can adapt when it gets worst ; the rough gets going the going gets rough ; when i start flowing the mic might bust ; the next state i shake from the power i generate ; people in cali used to think it was earthquakes ; because times was hard on the boulevard ; so i vote god and never get scarred and hauled ; but it seems like i am locked in hell ; looking over the edge but the r never fell ; a trip to slip because my nikes got grip ; stand on my own two feet and come equipped ; any stage i am seen on or mic i fiend on ; i stand alone and need nothing to lean on ; going for self with a long way to go ; so much to say but i still flow slow ; i come correct and i will not look back ; because it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; even the ghetto ; i learn to relax in my room and escape from new york ; and return through the bomb of the world as a thought ; thinking how hard it was to be born ; me been cream with no physical for ; millions of cell with one destination ; to reach the best part as life is creation ; nine months later a job well done ; make way because here i come ; since i made it this far i can not stop now ; there is a will and a way and i got the knowhow ; to be all i can be and more ; and see all there is to see before ; i am called to go back to the essence ; it is a lot to learn so i study my lessons ; i thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me ; i am glad i listened when my father was rapping to me ; because back in the days they lived in cares ; exiled from the original man they stayed away ; now that is what i call hard times ; i would rather be here to exercise the mind ; then i take a thought around the world twine ; from knowledge to born back to knowledge precise ; across the desert that is hot as the arabian ; but they could not have me in because i am the asia ; reaching for the city of mecca visit medina ; visions of nefertiti then i seen a ; mind keeps traveling i will be back after ; i stop and think about the brothers and sisters in africa ; return the thought through the eye of a needle ; for miles i thought and i just brought the people ; under the dark skins on a dark side ; not only there but right here is an apartheid ; so now is the time for us to react ; take a trip through the mind and when you get back ; understand your third eye seen all of that ; it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; even the ghetto ; no more props i want property in every borough ; nobody is stopping me because i am thorough ; rhymes i make gimme real state for me to own ; wherever i bless a microphone ; doubleohseven is back and relaxing ; on point and reaction and ready for action ; i am so low key that you might not see me ; incognito and taking it easy ghetto ; quiet as kept on a hush hush ; in front of a crowd i get loud there is a bum rush ; be calm keep a low pro and play the background ; hoping the whack rapper put the mic back down ; so rip it break it in half go ahead and sam it ; because when it is time to build i am a mechanic ; of bonding and mending attaching and blending ; so many solo there is no ending ; people in my neighborhood they know i am good ; from london to hollywood wherever i stood ; footprints remain on stage ever since ; sidewalks and streets i leave fossils and depts ; when i had sex i left my name on necks ; my trademark was left throughout the projects ; i used to get rich when i played cbo ; so i collect my cash then slide ; i have got my back my gun is on my side ; it should not have to be like that ; i guess it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; even the ghetto ; i am from the ghetto ; word up ; see if you can step to this ; ; and make sure the pace is kept ; and this is not as smooth as i am a get ; nice and easy but hard to catch on to ; move with melodies rhymes to respond to ; the mic is in front of me so you know it is gonna be ; rough and rugged plus i am smooth as i wanna be ; i am something like sipping on dom perignon ; so absorb the song til the rhyme is all gone ; my beats and speech original you can not find these ; eightynine is mine so is the nineties ; telling you what you need to know and more ; you are unsure on tour i explode ; from street to street to speak from beat after beat ; my cipher is complete when i build with people i meet ; so here is the into straight from the source in fact ; paid the cost to be the boss step back ; give me room to exercise the mind ; threehundred and sixty degrees will be fine ; the weight of the world is what we hold ; that is a six followed by twentyone heroes ; six sex shit gums is a lot of weight ; my truth is the strength and my thought will not break ; what it take concentration to rebuild our ; nation but we got to have mind power ; and we can make it work because i know we can ; and if something go wrong make another plan ; it is up to us so strive and be wise and ; when we reach the top do not stop rising ; and i will keep coming up with more of ; the most requested songs that you all love ; reach out and touch the mic take control ; still getting paid and i still got soul ; and the only thing i ever wanted you to follow was poetry ; mind takes xrays so listen closely ; from the darkness came the light clear out of a dark night ; now i am here to spark the mic ; send out truth for other groupy and substitutes ; with runon rhymes and weak dubs and looks ; they would rather hear the arsonist they insist ; no need to reminisce see if you can step to this ; step back ; eric b cuts up the phase ; so just step ; eric b cuts up the phase ; just step the rhymes create energy ; charged up by the cut and it is sending me ; for a trip through the mind so i can located ; a laid back rap at a slow rate ; it is not hard at all because i invented it ; as the days go on you hear them with it ; brother busting braincells thinking of a rap ; with the same old style we had enough of that ; we all need something to step to ; and do not forget to because i will not let you ; dance without hoping that this come on next ; and if it go off the dj can not flex ; because here is the tempo i am a regulate the pace ; here is the step go find some space ; and what we gonna do is in unison kick ; shake your head you are influenced with music ; by now you are intoxicated because i prove i made it ; the peep your step so soon you get rejuvenated ; from side to side you pause and clip ; but if you came to rap step back ; eric b cuts up the phase ; run for cover ; here i go again ready to flow again ; better hold my mic do not blow again ; warned by alarm when the mic gets warm ; crowd will get critical can not keep calm ; jet for the exit why hang around ; words that i found make the mic meet down ; if you stay better corporate because i amputate ; and whoever do not break i am a suffocate ; leave them with asthma you better pass the ; mic to the massacre master who has the ; power to build and destroy at the same time ; so track the wack at the right and exact could shine ; meant to beat overheat but i will not stop ; so evacuate the spot when the mic is hot ; switch it from one hand to another ; and that is a hit my brother run for cover ; because i am armed my brain contain a bomb ; as if i escaped from vietnam ; some people label me lethal lyrics i made then put beats to ; format collapse your lungs twist your tongue ; you can not bump your gums off of none of the drums ; words that i made will create an iller scene ; eric b is the fly human being on the guillotine ; hook them up to a respirator because it is the mista suffocator ; what i write is like showing a mic down your windpipe ; do not let him bit rhymes rakim write ; no mictomouth resuscitation is neccessary ; no obituary and if they are left they are buried ; as it strikes on the same mic twine and then ; cut it on and i am a strike again ; i mediate off the breaks till the place shake ; then i make rain hail snow and earthquakes ; speak the truth tear the roof off the mother ; the stage is stomping grounds run for cover ; scratching ; evacuate the building danger because i came to explain the ; strategy that will be tragic automatically ; having me to because another catastrophe ; all you gotta do is give rakim the ; buildings collapsing rappers getting trapped in ; areas closed off no one gets back in ; so set up roadblocks barracade the doors ; fade put a devour sign on the stage ; hold my microphone as evidence the weapon i use and been using ever since ; the days in the park when rap was an art then ; plus i was dominant determined and darkskinned ; making it hard to walk the streets at night ; for those who talk the weak beats on the mic ; whoever is living large better wear camouflage ; prepare to be bumrushed when i yell charge ; surround by sound of the beatdown another brother ; this is stomping grounds run for cover ; wheels or foot better not stay put ; whole place shook till the mic is unhooked ; then you have got seven minutes to vacate the premises ; lyrics will echo soon as the break finished ; do not act wild single file to the door ; no need for an encore just clear the floor ; because my mic is about to self destruct ; the stage will blow up when my rhymes erupt ; so make sure the place is clearer out and abandoned ; because minutes from now it will not be standing ; then send out and apb all poets beware of a brother like me ; now how many rhymes could your man manufacture ; how many biting mc can i capture ; trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth ; take over their route play them out like a cub shout ; so leave trooping for mc at war ; and if it is a battle let the crowd keep scare ; because me and the drummer make drama and that is word to motherrun for cover ; scratching ; this is poetry in motion ; try to catch on stay close to the host ; and mc is try to make the road rough but i am coasting ; ladies hear the rhymes rub me on like motion ; hit spots soothing can not stop moving ; go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet i am still cooling ; when i detain it is a brainstorm ; never the same for every brain i raised on is warm ; taking a trip through memory lane to melody ; see if you could tell if these thoughts to fell mc is ; could do you justice but you can not touch this ; some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed ; i am universal and much more merciful ; so versatile with the style it is reversable ; i get away even if i say a curse or two ; first let me bust another verse for you ; your arms too short to box with a so quit ; you do not want no kind of conflict ; or you will get strapped as the rhyme is ripped ; pick up the pieces now is not that peace yeah i am hip ; everything i said flows since my intro ; i plan a thought extend and then grow ; holding my pen tightly it might be ; controversy at first when i write the ; chorus of research do not just take it for granted ; when i am gone my mind remains a planet ; if i keep building and teach the children ; so when they read in between the lines it is filled in ; i break to mediate not a peep concentrate ; till i am deep awake but not asleep ; at the same time rising and advertisin ; what is true keep advised and you can stay wise ; and i am untouchable ; coming over the blidge take a speak at the skyline ; because that is how i shine not only when i rhyme ; my culture is making me stronger mentally ; physically i am powerful poetry now that could be ; labelled as art placed in a museum ; style will make scenery now you see them ; exhibit a knowledge that is packed and filled with ; nothing illiterate it is facts i build with ; my mind is untouchable which means intangible ; contents never sense it is understandable ; i study life so i can live it the right way ; no time to hear what another brother might say ; why sell a capsule of crack i do not have to ; i rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to ; put message on records that is grace with hard bass ; smugglin microphones this is not scarface ; whoever talked that talk i wanna hawk ; and do not try to escape from new york ; cross a hundred and tenth street looking for a problem ; it is hell up in harlem watch a solve me ; i hear the music clear as i get near ; the hundred and twenty fifth street apollo heater ; take a step back when i rap i step up to you ; i am untouchable ; put on my thinking cap pump the track ; test your reflex relax but in contact ; you fold and lose control so hold your partner closer ; you are supposed to keep your composure ; but you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype ; it is like intro opponents get petro ; remember the trademark left by the r ; that is never soft or smooth it is coming off the hardest ; in effect you could detect the imposter ; taking my props rakim is still proper ; i am a prophet you can not stop it when i drop it ; everything i say coincide with the topic ; thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured ; inside my brain it is all manufactured ; as we go deeper it is hard to find ; do not even think about it because you can not read my mind ; it is clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined ; in the mind with some kind of idea for ; the style i am advertisin what is true ; keep advised that you stay wise and the mind ; is untouchable ; verse one ; me and eric b was cooling at the paladium ; sorry if you are in a rush do not let me hold ya up ; or interveen or interrupt but ; you got the look i wanna get to know ya better ; i had to let her know but yo i did not sweat her ; because if you woulda seen what i was seeing ; almost looked korean but european ; when she spoke her accent was selfexplanatory ; even her body language told the story ; her name was mahogony win is name was ebony ; so we could talk and see new york ; show time does not start until one of the clock ; and once i entered your mind i would not wanna stop ; carressing ya thoughts till we was thinking the same ; calm ya nerves message ya brain ; each mic is a mineral poetry is protein ; verse is a vitamin affects like codeine ; so tell me how you feel and i will reveals ; a will that will heal ya pain because i am real ; she must have did because she could not resist ; she spoke slowly when she told me this she said ; chorus ; over me she is going crazy ; she will rub me on my chest and call me mr sexy ; she said she would have my kids and help me make my next g ; tell me i is not finesse mahogony ; verse two ; so i prescribed her something to revive ; and surprise her she is liver and much more wise ; than the light i shine when my brain cell spark ; come to me so we can blow in the dark ; and soon you can represent the moon ; as long as i keep ya in tone ; i will tell ya who ya are and why ya here ; take it in strike because it might take a year ; it is funny how time lies when ya having fun ; we got close and it was almost one ; she dissed me slow but you know how far a kiss can go ; fuck around and miss the show ; so i told her to hold that thought real tight ; we can finish where we left off later on tonite ; back to the scene of the crime on time ; as they introduced the fiend of the rhyme ; she stood with a birdseye view of me ; thinking of later on of what she would do to me ; the back of the room i could see her eyes gloom ; patient but hoping that the show was over soon ; as the place was ripped in half she made her way to the front row ; i packed my mic as they screamed for an encore ; the speakers were blown plus my mic was some ; besides i got places to go ladies to see ; and she could tell me how crazy she was over me ; we drove off she said she liked the way that i performed ; and could not wait to get soft and warm i said ; looks i receive made it hard to mc ; i can take a hit so i knew that she ; showed her some lights then i took her to the condom ; she was piping hot but i kept my calm so ; she asked how come i do not smile ; as we reached the kingdom she said bring some ; champagne she will entertain then sing some ; sentimental songs real gently ; it hit the spot and you know where it went to ; as we embraced i felt her heart pumping ; i knew she was in the good for something ; so i laid on my back and related ; it was not the perignon that made her collaspe ; over me ; me and the rap is laid back ; nonchalant and related in the track ; put together well so it is not hard to tell ; easy to recognize so my records will sell ; on the microphone well known with a low tone ; show and prove when the stage show is shown ; all you hear is screams when i am hit by the later beams ; ladies fiend rappers are choosen up tears ; so who could beat up just before we meet up ; before i kick a rhyme i kick my feet up ; to let you know everything is under control ; under surveillance taking over your soul ; so let me handle this getting scandalous ; all my jams are hits never plan to miss ; crowd is captured released at my permission ; peep me as i keep me pager to listen ; opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down ; left with a little sight ears still hear the sound ; try to clear your mind but it is still there ; give him about a year then give him a wheelchair ; i damage and deteriorate til your brain dead ; no cuss cuss what i discuss will bust his head ; here is some hearing aids when your eardrums fail ; you get scars so you could read it in braille ; close your third eye then i do body work ; and i keep the same procedure til somebody is hurt ; my dj will sew up cuts like an my ; and i still move crowds like an mc ; entertain and tear you out of your frame ; leave you in a puddle of blood then let it rain ; then i get deep so try to withstand ; on my level to think or sink like quicksand ; he could not hang so i cut the rope short ; watching me fall because they need more support ; this is the way that i done all of my competition ; peep me as i keep me pager to listen ; keep me pager to listen ; the performance i give me is something like a hypnotism ; swinging back and forth til you can keep the rhythm ; at the tone of my voice you will become ; pager to listen dance in a trace til you see the ; r on stage no cheeks all ears ; all three of your eyes on me so it appears ; just like you thought it would be but even better ; live and direct on stage instead of the ; radio or video or studio rehearsin ; i am at my best in the flesh in person ; the main attraction center of attention ; the crowd will go crazy soon as i mention ; it is time to communicate so let us conversate ; i get my point across when you respond i make sense ; so now we could continue the mission ; as i keep me pager to listen ; i used to always say one day ; i will play in the na because i will slay ; opponents well and also excel ; as a black quarterback in the nfl ; i throw to scare so i can hear the crowd road ; keep me out of they seats and on the floor ; and when i win it will pump my adrenaline ; my record is undefeated and i will win again ; i will never lose or hear boom from the audience ; because they participate and applaud me since ; i bring me what they want to hear ; and they will fill up the atmopshere ; with people that came to party and have a good time ; so when i am gone i am sure you understood the rhyme ; because i promise to accomplish the mission ; i came to set me straight and let me know ; whoever is holding the best just let him go ; because here is the inside scoop on the fiend ; they wanna know why i am seldom seen ; because who needs the tv screen and magazines ; or shooting through the city in fly limousines ; there is one thing i do not like it is the spotlight ; because i already got light ; because my schedule is tight i gotta write ; i am deep in the archives and keeping me hyped ; it is been a long time since you heard a strong rhyme ; none of these are weak so when you bite on mine ; we can trace the hits and then name that style ; mc'sll be out of a job for a while ; i reposess your indentification ; so hand in your application ; put your mic on strike until you are unemployed ; contract is up and i am stamping it avoid ; your election is not that selective ; so i am a put you in your proper perspective ; on the dancefloor and down the shake ; ready to let me brake set me straight ; somebody said i set me up and pulled the plug on me ; but instead i let me go on so i could but on me ; go ahead and flow because i close the show ; swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow ; for instance once i commence ; the crowd is convinced ; so now you know who to put your money on ; hurry up before your money is gone ; because i am the most common denominator ; orchestrate a rhyme much greater ; i am like a world almanac so tell the media ; giving me information like encyclopedia ; so bring a dictionary so you can look it up ; so you know what i mean when i hook it up ; no misconceptions although i complicate ; but this concept will set me straight ; they even said that i was locked in jail ; so now i guess i am out on bail ; the only island i was on was the strong one ; and if i did my bid it will be a long one ; because if i sold weight i would be upstate ; in the penile waiting for a brake ; because selling drugs is for handicaps ; i got too many skills besides busting rough raps ; if i go to jail it will not be for selling ki is ; it will be for mudering mc is ; the beat will take over your heart then i start ; to cut me in half because rhymes are razor sharp ; secure the exist all mc is remain ; because we got a crowd to entertain ; and i know when i go i will flow dangerous ; braingsll bust what you trying to explain to us ; you got lost and could not go on ; came up short so here is one to grow on ; elevated off a high i ; in time you will find i am true ; because once i start on a piece of art ; from sun to moon and light to dark i build the are ; now you can float off the rhymes i wrote ; i am sure that we will hit short without a boat ; you could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked ; attacked with a torpedo what did you expect ; drifting up the creep without a beat or a paddle ; castaway on a rat and stand fragile ; rescue your crowd which is not a hard job ; me and my knowledge put together i am a lifeguard ; dealing with actual facts it sold out fat ; here and now but i go so far back ; to bring you up to date so we can elevated ; it is no time to wait or anticipate ; because i am never late i am gonna motivate ; let the rhythm hit them ; i am the arsenal ; i got artillery lyrics of ammo ; rounds of rhythm ; then i am a give them piano ; bring a bulletproof vest ; nothing to ricochet ; ready to aim at the brain ; now what the trigger say ; tempo trifling ; felt like a rifle ; message and melodies ; might go right through ; simultaneously like an uzi ; nothing can cruise me ; lyrics let up when lady say do not lose me ; so reload quickly ; and you better hit me ; while i am letting this fifi get wit me ; you stepping with i i i ; better make it snappy ; no time to do your hair baby ; brothers are busting at me ; beats and bullet us pass me ; none on target ; they want the r hit ; but watch the god get ; quicker the tongue is the trigger ; because i am real fast ; let off some rhythm at them ; let them feel the blast ; penetrate at a crazy rate ; this is not no i ; hit them at point blank range ; and watch them radiate ; running out of ammunition ; i am done with me ; you ask me how i did them ; i let the rhythm hit them ; i push a power that is punishable ; better be a prisoner ; the hit man is the ; brother with charisma ; showing you that i have ; powerful paragraphs ; followers will become leaders ; but without a path ; ya mentally paralyzed ; crippled ya third eye ; rhymes are blurred ; then it occurred that you heard i ; reduced the friction with crucifixion ; let loose the mix then ; boost the pistol ; eric hit them with some of that ; cut like a lumberjack ; and me getting hit back ; it will not be none of that ; i am untouchable ; you see me in d ; when i let the rhythm hit another mc ; lyrics made of lead ; enter your head ; then eruptions of a mass production ; will spread when ; music is louder ; full of gunpower ; microphone machinery ; when i see a crowd of ; party people pumping ; their fist like this ; ya hide in the back ; thinking that i might miss ; but the r is accurate ; plus i am packed up with ; educated punch lines that ; i have to hit ; whatever i aim at ; i like them up ; ya body is weak feel with pain ; that time is up ; you been hit with something ; different is not it ; rakim is gonna radiate and nothing is equivalent ; nothing can harm me ; why try to bar me ; you could not come around to rob with a army ; you will get wrecked by the architect ; so respect them ; i disconnect them soon as i inject them ; with radiation ; put them by the basement ; bust his chest open ; bash his face in ; let it split him ; since he brought his main man with him ; he ask me how i did him ; i let the rhythm hit him ; let it hit him ; dance floor is dangerous ; packed in like a briefcase ; rhythm with real rough rhyme ; beats with deep bass ; girls with tight wants ; maybe they might dance ; tonight if the is on the mike ; there is a slight chance ; the crowd is crucial ; mc is grounds are neutral ; now that you are here let me introduce you ; get ready ; i am hard read like graffiti but steady ; science i drop is real heavy ; radiant energy that will be the penals ; touch the third jail on the pain of remedy ; the prescription is one every hour ; now it is a havoc ; if ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatics ; attention follow directions real close ; keep out of reach of children ; beware of overdose ; too many milligram ; but what made a iller jam ; my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts ; that kill a man ; i dead for the ear to fear ; might split him ; he will never forget him ; he will rest in peace with them ; at least when he left he will know what hit him ; the last breath of the words of death ; was the rhythm ; now throw you hands in the air and yo go ; rakim will do the rest of this slow ; if i speed they know you will blow the hell up ; if i slow up catch up hell no ; wicked as i kicked it ; do not need to remi it ; because i prefixed it ; reversed and switched it ; to perform to perfection ; section for section ; rhymes keep connecting ; ya guessing what is expand ; blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it ; ya hit the ground burning and woke up frostbitten ; because when i explained ya can not complain for pain ; travel through the brain hit a vein ; then remain let it radiate ; vibes will vibrate ; why did you violated ; now i am a have to let the style break ; means now the tone is ingrown ; after this here is thrown gimme another microphone ; before i get that fifi i met ; whisper i wanna reach your intellect ; kiss her because i wanna give her the most respect ; so i shine and let the write reflect ; hold her mold her make her feel older ; lay her on my shoulder ; everything i told her ; makes her feel secure whenever i am with her ; and you know how i did her ; me and the rhythm hit her ; i seen her in the subway on my way to brooklyn ; hell good looking is this seat tooken ; on the train kicking at her brain ; i could not get her number i could not get her name ; i said i still like your style of fashion ; but i hate your hostile bitty attitude wit a passion ; is it because brothers like to hawk alot ; is it because your sign do not talk alot ; she turned away no play i said ok ; you do not really look good i hope you have a bad day ; sat back related though the ride was tight ; i was thinking of the rhymes i wrote last night ; next stop was mine a familiar scene ; i was meeting my friend killer ben in it green ; where the girls are real they tell ya how they feel ; if you are soft you are soft or if you are hard like steel ; see i do not bend and i will not just ; and i do not break and i will not bust ; stomped up the street and did i hear a treat ; hard high feels tapping on the concrete ; i took a peep it was the girl from the train behind me ; did she live in the area was she trying to find me ; am i did not wanna play myself out ; i played it off stopped and i bought a guiness shout ; now was she she she did not walk by ; she came in the store then she even said i ; curiosity at a high velocity ; maybe possibly she had the hot for me ; i said if we are playing games then we are gonna play mine ; i am a lay the rules because it is not much time ; if you hide your feelings and they hard to find ; i wanna know what is on your mind ; chorus ; i said yo can i speak to am she said no ; hey yo i know i did not call i did not wanna stress you ; go out my way to impress you press to undress you ; see i wanna get to know you so i can show you ; what a strong relationship can grow to ; but you gotta trust me and you are gonna love me ; squeeze the phone and thug me use your mind to rub me ; now how does it feel when my mental message ya temple ; telephone is hot from the vibes that i sent you ; now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotion ; next you see ecstacy is explosions ; now i am coming to see you to spend some time ; i am a romantic warrior but is it a crime ; and if you hide your feelings and they hard to find ; i wanna know what is on your mind ; now it is been months and it is smooth and lovely ; i am in your head so you will be thinking of me ; so we met in queens and went to valley screams ; and uh could not remember the movie we just seen ; but it is wednesday take the train uptown ; how do the 2fifth street sound ; amateur night showtime at the apollo ; probably be watching bill cosby tomorrow ; then after that get into it i mean intimate ; every word is an instrument ; making sounds and ones and songs and means ; my lips so close to your ear it is like headphones ; you smile you said you never know what the day will bring ; it is always a new song to sing ; the next day i went back to the her rest ; knocked on the door intentions finesse ; she let me in and had nothing but a neglige on ; selling like lie claiborne ; i sat down and got comfortable and watched the huxtables ; she sat next to me and said what is up wit you ; i got the feeling for sexual hearing ; a mental hearing how you feeling ; she caught the effect and said she feel the same ; could you message my intellect and stop the pain ; desire is learning the fire is burning ; you hot because it is alot you are learning ; now i am ready to explode you inner world ; it is take a long time because i am just beginning girl ; take it easy cut off the tv ; cut off the lights use your mind to see me ; use your physical for if i am hard to find ; because now i know what is on your mind ; no more time to pass time because these are the last rhymes ; because we are living in the last times ; they wanna go to war more wars to come ; but most of us fight more wars than one ; discrimination in the racial nation ; while they destroy our strong foundation ; nature is balance is way off balance ; they tip the scare now it is no more silence ; the hole in the zone layer is out of control ; but they wanna fight for more oil and gold ; unemployment i got laid off ; the streets is the last reports to get paid off ; for more more mint no doe for rent ; i gotta shed blood to make a red cent ; maybe i should ask the president ; somebody give me the president ; but he do not want to hear it it is out of the question ; because in my section it is worse than recession ; so i go to a rich neighborhood and play robin hood ; take from the bad and give to the good ; first i go to bensonhurst steal a benz snatch a purse ; pick up my friends that is when it gets worse ; because i need government and they need government ; alot of mint spent now i gotta pay rent ; who makes the most dead presidents in the projects ; you are gonna get robbed and wrecked ; i packed up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot ; let us get him for all he got ; i approached him slow like i was a base head ; put the fofifth to his face and said ; you see those kids over there wit the hoods ; walk to them real slow and give them the good ; first the gun and the doe and crush the jumbos ; one false move and no one knows ; because i got a silencer to hush the bust ; and i am in a rush so hush the fuss ; plus the poison you fed will no longer spread ; you good as dead i am a fill your head wit lead ; that is when i pushed him into his building ; to murder him but i remember the children ; chorus ; we gotta teach the children everyday keep a song ; show them the light teach them right from wrong ; make some sense so they can carry on ; teach the children ; we gotta teach the children so that they can sing along ; understand the words in this song ; teach the children save the nation ; i see the destruction the situation ; they are corrupt and their time is up soon ; but they will blow it up and prepare life on the moon ; sounds like total recall ; but who gotta spaceship you get it we fall ; so hope for the best and expect the worst ; the end is near and it is uzi verse ; the one is that intervene wit nature ; labelled you limited and underrate ya ; his plans over rule when he separates ya ; now it is uzi verse the one that hate ya ; so we gotta let them know we are hip to the script ; change the shit or we are about to flip ; because we want access to happiness ; living the good life and much success ; equal opportunity ; self awareness and unity ; education the kids need a sculpture ; teach them the abacus and their culture ; and that will help stop the robbing rapping and killing ; poison neighborhoods are illing ; but they import more keys from across seat ; a drug disease hits the streets wit ease ; so keep on building because we gotta keep building ; till the answers are filled in ; and make sure you do not stop till then ; pass the hand grenade ; it is gonna blow because i took out the pin ; detach the detonator date send ; programmed wit protons equipped wit predicates ; electrons and elements just fit ; your pronoun hits the ground and that is that ; hit the floor like a meteor so get back ; commas punctuation marks separate it sparks ; follow the course in to avoid getting shared ; more volts than a lightning bold handle with care ; i am far from fragile warfare will not tear ; i am armed and dangerous trained for combat ; let off rounds and they will not just bomb back ; explosions i made to invade your parade ; your weak beat is i decay untill they can not get played ; wrong elements in the mic they get sprayed ; pass the hand grenade ; after the stage gets warm i heat it up ; the crowd gets charged i speed it up ; they could not get warm gimme a cut ; the rhyme gets good so eat it up ; food for thought until your thoughts is some ; fill up a colosseum i can serve them all ; bake another plate and cook it far from raw ; and if your overweight then here is some more ; because every wish i make taste great and ; plus filling if i sold a third of my rhymes i make a killing ; get the salt and pepper from the said ; get the blood off the blade pass the hand grenade ; if you try this your response is tonsilitis ; i am leaving authors and writers with arthritis ; you got the slightest idea i got the brightest ; here is the slightest so clear it is out of sight it is ; darkness from the darkness came the light ; the night is the time for a to recite it ; educated but complicated style ; for all the bites i am shutting rappers up like ridas ; i got the force of a turbo porsche ; you get lost in the sauce and then thrown off course ; you can not destroy the decoys so devour ; no sense of direction so what ya speed for ; you would not of never made it how many styles have i created ; so many rhymes i bust ya frustrated ; then the mic will self sestruct you will get sprayed ; casualties of war ; casualties of war as i approach the barricade ; where is the enemy who do i invade ; bullet us of teflon bulletproof vest rip ; tear ya out of ya frame with a bag full of clips ; because i got a family that wait for my return ; to get back home is my main concern ; i am a get back to new york in one piece ; but i am beat in the sand that is hot as the city streets ; sky lights up like fireworks blind me ; bullet us whistling over my head remind me ; president bush said attack ; flashback to nam i might not make it back ; missle hits the area screams wake me up ; from a war of dreams heat up the my ; basic training trained for torture ; take no prisoners and i just caught ya ; addicted to murder send more bodybags ; they can not identify me leave the nametags ; i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor ; casualties of war x ; day divided the night and night divided the day ; it is all hard work and no play ; more than combat it is far beyond that ; because i got a kill or be killed kind of attack ; area is rapped out there will be no stratego ; me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go ; but what are we here for who is on the other side of the wall ; somebody give the president a call ; but i hear warfare scream through the air ; back to the battlegrounds it is war they declare ; a desert storm let us see who reign supreme ; something like monopoly a government scheme ; go to the army be all you can be ; another dead soldier hell no not me ; so i start letting off ammunition in every direction ; allah is my only protection ; but wait a minute saddam hussein rays the same ; and this is asia from where i came ; i am on the wrong side so change the target ; shooting at the general and where is the sergeant ; blame it on john hard hawkins for bringing me to america ; now it is mass hysteria ; i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor ; casualties of war x ; the war is over for now at least ; just because they lost it do not mean it is peace ; it is a long way home it is a lot to think about ; whole generation left in doubt ; innocent families killed in the mist ; it will be more dead people after this ; so i am glad to be alive and walking ; half of my platoon came home in coffins ; except the general buried in the storm ; in its and pieces no need to look for me ; i played it slick and got away with it ; rugged it up so they would think they did it ; now i am home on deserves and you can bet ; when they call i am going awol ; because it is not no way i am going back to war ; when i do not know who or what i am fighting for ; so i wait for terrorists to attack ; every time a truck backfires i fire back ; i look for shelter when a plane is over me ; remember pearl harbor new york could be over g ; kamikaze strapped with bombs ; no peace in the east they want revenge for saddam ; did i hear gunshots or thunder ; no time to wonder somebody is going under ; put on my fatigues and my camoflouge ; take control because i am in charge ; when i snapped out of it it was blood dead bodies on the floor ; double oh seven is back ; i do not stress my day because it is best to parlay ; i guess you could say i have been away ; i wake up slow when i am hot but i destruct the plan ; and fourteen hands come new york for fans ; they make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed ; pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread ; a morning message turning into a real rough rubdown ; so i figured i will lay around ; they keep me wet with a juice called tahiti ; it make the room steady so soon they could not see me ; they know more than calisthetics as they worked up a sweat ; it was not even ten of the clock yet ; scrub down then i get most they never treat me mean ; they sweetly keep me squeaky clean ; i chill as they filled the jabebecausezi ; it is not hard because it is miles from the sidewalk ; i am overlooking every borough in new york ; the entire empire state to concentrate ; for every rhyme i make ; so at exactly soon they played my favorite tone ; and just before they all clearer the room ; but they wanna go to war they even tried to shoot up the door ; double oh seven is back ; rest assured ; double oh seven is back ; feel secure ; double oh seven is back ; i am filling up the page when i am stepping on stage ; got the people in a rage with they hands in the air ; fellas saying hoe everybody yelling go ; that is how they react when i attack the mic ; in fact it is like a stack of dynamite powerful and bright ; girls love to squeeze me real tight ; double oh seven is back ; a has returned to romance me better than johnny handsome ; is not nothing change but the year and i am still here ; mere dear and let me whisper in your ear ; thug my words so i can taste your lips ; i set up hips like domino chips ; but i do not let me hit the floor ; and if you got some then feel secure ; where is the pain is it the spot you set us in ; almost magic better than medicine ; take one of these and put your mind at ease ; i get more work than a lot of my is ; if i am hawkin new york or out on tour ; i express the raw fialect and explode ; but do not get fooled by metaphor ; double oh seven is back ; rest assured ; feel secure ; rest assured ; kill him again ; try to identify the man in front of ya ; but it is not the role the gear or the money the ; shift intellectionist with plenty ya ; bite if it is dark i will spark every one of ya ; i throw a mic in the crowd it is a question ; i got the answer it includes directions ; attack your wack untill it is handicapped ; you will never hold the mic again try to hand it back ; because every rapper that comes i cut off his thumbs ; put a record to his neck if he swallows it hugs ; slide from ear to ears untill can hear better ; before he bleed to death here hear every letter ; and you can see quick and thick the blood can get ; if you try to change the style or the object ; as i get deep in the rhyme i am becoming a ; emcee murdererbefore i am done i am a ; prepare the chamber the torture is coming up ; trip through the mind at the end you will find it is ; the punisher ; kill them again ; i hold the mic as hostage emcees are ransome ; rhymes will punish them because they do not undertsand them ; i heat up his brain then explain then i hand him ; a redhot microphonethat is how i planned them ; rhymes call information unite midnught ; like a platoon putting bullet wounds in the mic ; if ya curse me it is not no mercy ; give him a autopsy killed by a verse of me ; i took a kid and cut off his eyelid ; kill him slow so he could see what i did ; and if he do not understand what i said ; i am pushing his eyeballs way to the back of his head ; so he can see what he is getting into ; a part of the mind that he never been through ; a journey is coming because ya getting sent to ; a place harder to find but it is all in the mental ; i ran a brainscan to located his game plan ; when i am through with his brain he is not the same man ; did he lose his mind or lost in his mind ; but this is not the lost and found because ya can not find ; your foundation coasting your mind is ; drifting in slow motionfrozen ; looks like another murder at the mardi gas b ; too late to send out a search party ; once ya out of ya head then ya can not get back ; i give them a map but he still get trapped so ; prepare the chamber the torture is coming up ; trip through the mind at the end you will find it is the punisher ; kill them again ; dangerous rhymes are performed like surgery ; cuts so deep you will be bleeding burgundy ; my intellect wreck and disconnects your cerebral cortex ; your cerebellum is next ; your conscience becomes subconscious ; soon your response is nonsense ; the last words are blurredmumbled then blurred ; then your herbs are no longer heard ; you get your long tried so good you are tonguetied ; he could not swing or hang so he hung untill he died ; reincarnate him and kill him againagain and againagain and again ; i leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him ; i got a dead mc ing museum ; when i create them i create them and complicate them ; you can not save themthere is no ultamatum ; mic is lay around full of asses with the victim is name in slashes ; got a long list and i am a get every one of ya ; beware of the punisher ; then i am a kill them again ;

i can not hold it back i am looking for the like ; taking off my coat clearing my throat ; my rhyme will be kicking it until i hit my last not ; my mind will range to find all kinds of idea ; selfesteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build ; but still say a rhyme after the next one ; prepared never scared i will just bless one ; and you know that i am the soloist ; so eric b make them clip to this ; i do not but out or chill or be acting ill ; no tricks in '86 it is time to build ; eric b easy on the cut no mistakes allowed ; because to me mc means move the crowd ; i made it easy to dance to this ; but can you detect what is coming next from the flex of the wrist ; saying indeed that i precede because my man made a mix ; if he bleed he will not need no bandaid to fix ; if they can get some around until there is no rhymes left ; i hurry up because the cut will make them bleed to death ; but he is kicking it because it is not no half stepping ; the party is live the rhyme can not be kept in ; side it needs erupting just like a volcano ; it is not the everyday style of the same old rhyme ; because i am better then the rest of them ; eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim ; go get a girl and get soft and warm ; do not get excited you have been invited to a quiet storm ; but now it is out of hand because you told me you hate me ; and then you ask what have i done lately ; first you said all you want is love and affection ; let me be your angel and i will be your protection ; take you out buy you all kinds of things ; i must of got you too hot and burned off your wings ; you caught an attitude you need food to eat up ; i am scheming like i am dreaming on a couch wit my feet up ; you scream i am lay you must be crazy ; thought i was a donut you tried to blaze me ; funky ; i was a fiend before i became a teen ; i melted microphone instead of ones of ice cream ; music orientated so when hiphop was originated ; fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated ; they tried to take it and say that i am too small ; cool because i do not get upset ; i kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then i jet ; back to the la without a mic to grab ; so then i and all the rhymes i had ; one after the other one then i make another one ; to is the opposite then ask if the brother is done ; i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine ; but i do not need a cigarette know what i mean ; i am paging ripping up the stage and ; do not it sound amazing because every rhyme is made and ; thought of because it is sort fan addiction ; magnatized by the mixing ; vocal vocabulary your verse you are stuck in ; the mic is a drano volcanoes erupting ; rhymes overflowing gradually growing ; everything is written in the cold so it can chin ; ride my thoughts to guide ; i tracks to slide ; the invincible microphone fiend rakim ; spread the word because i am in ; effect ; a smooth operated operating correctly ; but back to the problem i gotta habit ; you can not solve it silly rabbit ; the prescription is a hypertone that is thorough when ; i fiend for a microphone like heroin ; soon as the bass kicks i need a fix ; gimme a stage and a mic and a mix ; and i will put you in a good or is it a state of ; unawareness beware it is the reanamator ; a menace to a microphone a lethal weapon ; an assasinator if the people is not stepping ; you see a part of me that you never seen ; when i am fiending for a microphone i am the microphone fiend ; verse i ; after i i am worse that a gremlin ; feed me hiphop and i start trembling ; the thrill of suspense is intense your horrified ; by any means neccesary this is what has to be done ; make way because here i come ; my dj cuts material ; grand imperial ; it is a must that i bust any mic you are hand to me ; it is inherited it is runs in the family ; i wrote the rhyme that broke the bull is back ; if that do not slow them up i carry a full pack ; now i do not want to have to let off you should of kept off ; you did not keep the stage warm step off ; ladies and gentleman you are about to see ; a pasttime hobby about to be ; take it to the maximum i can not relax see i am ; hype as a hyperchrondriac because the rap be one ; hell of a antidote something you can not smoke ; more than dope you are trying to move away but you can not you are broke ; more than cracker up you should have backed up ; for those who act up need to be more than smacked up ; any entertainer i got a torture chamber ; one on one and i am the remainder ; so close your eyes and hold your breath ; and i am a hit ya wit the blow of death ; before you go you will remember you seen ; the fiend of a microphone i am the microphone fiend ; i is not no joke i use to let the mic smoke ; now i sam it when i am done and make sure it is broke ; when i am gone no on gets on because i will not let ; nobody press up and mess up the scene i set ; but think about it then you will understand ; i am just an addict addicted to music ; maybe it is a habit i gotta use it ; even if it is jayz or the quiet storm ; i hook a beat up convert it into hiphop for ; write a rhyme in grafitti and every show you see me in ; deep concentration because i am no comedian ; jokes are wild if you wanna be named ; i treat you like a child then you are gonna be named ; another enemy not even a friend of me ; because you will get tried in the end when you pretend to be ; composing because i just put your mind on pause ; and i complete when you compare my rhyme with yours ; i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned ; remember me the one you got your idea from ; but soon you start to suffer the tone will get rougher ; when you start to stutter that is when you had enough of ; biting it will make you choke you can not provoked ; you can not cope you should have broke because i is not no joke ; i got a question it is serious as cancer ; who can keep the average dance ; hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling ; because you are expression the rhyme that i am styling ; this is what we all sit down to write ; you can not make it so you take it home break it and bite ; use pieces and its of all my hiphop hits ; get the style down pat then it is time to switch ; put my tape on pause and and some more to yours ; then you figured you are ready for the neighborhood chorus ; a emcee do not even try to be ; when you come up to speak do not even lie to me ; you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate ; then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me ; so when you see me come up freeze ; or you will be one of those seven mc is ; they think that i am a new jack but only if they knew that ; they who think wrong are they who can not do that ; style that i am down they might run ; patterns of paragraphs based on you and ; your offbeat dj if anything he play ; sound familiar i will wait until e say ; you can get a smack for this i is not no joke ; i hold the microphone like a grudge ; b will hold the record so the needle do not judge ; i hold a conversation because when i invest ; when i see you i will kick a freestyle going steadily ; but whatever you do do not miss one ; there will be another rough rhyme after this one ; before you know it you are followin and fiending ; waiting for the punchline to get the meaning ; like before the middle of my story i am telling ; nobody beats the r so stop yelling ; save it put it in your pocket for later ; no interruptions until the mic is broke ; when i am gone then you can joke ; because everything is real on a serious tip ; keep playing and i get furious quick ; and i will take you for a walk through hell ; feed your dome then watch your eyeballs swell ; guide you out of triple stage darkness ; when it get dark again then i am a spark this ; microphone because the heat is on you see smoke ; and i am finished when the beat is gone i am no joke ; verse one ; poets are paranoid dj is destroyed ; because i came back to attack others in spit ; strike like lightning it is quite frightening ; but do not be afraid in the dark in a park ; not a scream or a cry or a back more like a spark ; ya treble like a alcoholic muscles tighter up ; what is that lighten up you see a sight but ; suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick ; you grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick ; music is the clue when i come your warned ; apocolypse now when i am done ya gone ; have not you ever heard of a murderer ; this is the death penaltyand i am serving a ; death wish so come on step to this ; hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist ; friday the thirteenth walking down elm street ; you come in my real ya get beat ; this is off limit so your visions are blurry ; all ya see is the meters at a volume ; pumping lyrics of fury ; it is a fearified freestyle ; terror in the styles never errorfiles ; indeed i am known your exiled ; for those that opposed to be level or next to this ; i is not a devil and this is not the exorcist ; worse than a nightmare you do not have to sleep a wink ; the pain is a migraine every time ya think ; flashbacks intervene ya start to hear ; the rakim in your ear ; then the beat is hysterical ; that makes eric go get a a and cops the wack ; soon the lyrical format is superior ; faces of death remain ; mc is decaying because they never stayed ; the scene of a crime every night at the show ; the fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know ; it is only one capable breaks the unbreakable ; melodiesunmakable patternunecscapable ; a horn if want the style i posse ; i bless the child the earth the god and bomb the rest ; for those that envy a mc it can be ; hazardous to your health so be friendly ; a matter of life and death just like a ethchasketch ; shake untill your clear make it disappear make the next ; after the ceremony let the rhyme rest in peace ; if not my soul will release ; the scene is recreated reincarnated updated i am glad you made it ; because your about to see a disasterous sight ; a performance never again performed on a mic ; lyrics of fury ; a fearified freestyle ; make sure the system is loud when i mention ; phrases that is fearsome ; you want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums ; i sit back and observe the whole scenery ; then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me ; strictly business i am quickly in this good ; and i do not care if the whole crowd is a witness ; i am a tear you apart but i am a spare you a heart ; program into the speed of the rhyme prepare to start ; rhythm is out of the radius insane as the craziest ; musical madness mc ever made see it is ; now an emergency openheart surgery ; open your mind you will find every word will be ; furier than ever i remain the future ; battle is temptingwhatever suits ya ; for words the sentence there is no resemblance ; you think you are suffer then suffer the consequences ; i am never dyingterrifying results ; i wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts ; mictomouth resuscitation rhythm with radiation ; novicane ease the pain it might save him ; if not eric b is the judge the crowd is the jury ; how do i lead to homicide ; lyrics of fury ; they are getting furier a fearified freestyle ; verse one ; turn up the bass check out my melody hand out a cigar ; i am letting knowledge be born and my name is the r ; rakim not like the rest of them i am not on a list ; that is what i am saying i drop science like a scientist ; my melody is in a code the very next episodes ; has the mic often distorting ready to explode ; i keep the mic in fahrenheit freeze mc is and make me colder ; the listened is system is kicking like solar ; as i memorize advertise like a moet ; keep you going when i am flowing smooth enough you know it ; but rough that is why the middle of my story i tell be ; verse two ; so what if i am a microphone fiend addicted soon as i sing ; one of these for mc is so they do not have to scream ; i could not wait to take the mic flow into it to test ; then let my melody play and then the record suggest ; that i am dropping bombs but i stay peace and calm ; any mc that disagree with me just have your arm ; and i will break when i am through breaking i will leave you broke ; drop the mic when i am finished and watch it smoke ; so stand back you wanna rap all of that can wait ; i will not push i will not beat around the bush ; i wanna break upon those who are not supposed to ; you might try but you can not get close to ; because i am number one competition is none ; i am measures with the heat that is made by sun ; whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall ; i just writing my name in graffiti on the wall ; you should not have told me you said you control me ; so now a contest is what you owe me ; pull out your money pull out your cut ; pull up a chain and i am a tear shit up ; so easily will i emcee ; some bass and treble is most scratching and cutting a voice ; and when it is mine that is when the rhyme is always choice ; i would not have came to set my name around the same weak shit ; putting blues and slugs and words that do not fit ; in a rhyme why waste time on the microphone ; i take this more serious than just a poem ; rockin party to party backyard to yard ; now tear it up you all and bless the mic for the god ; verse three ; the rhyme is rugged at the same time sharp ; i can swing off anything even a string of a hard ; just turn it on and start rockin mind no introduction ; til i finish dropping science no interruption ; when i approach i exercise like a couch ; sin a melody and and numerous notes ; with the mic and the rakim ; it is a task like a match i will strike again ; rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped ; put in older to pursue with the momentum except ; i say one rhyme and i older a longer rhyme shorter ; a pause but do not stop the tape recorder ; verse four ; i am not a regular competitor first rhyme editor ; melody arrange moet etcetera ; extra event the grand final like bonus ; i am the man they call the microphonist ; with wisdom which means wise words been spoken ; too many at one time watch the mic start smoking ; i came to express the rap i manifest ; stand in my way and i will lead a words protect ; mc is that wanna be dissed they are gonna ; be dissed if they do not get from in front ; all they can go get is me a glass of moet ; a hard time sip your juice and watch a smooth moet ; i take i mc is put me in a like ; and and i more brothers who think they can rhyme ; well it will take i more before i go for mine ; and that is i mc is ate up at the same time ; easy does it do it easy that is what i am down ; no fessing no messing around no chewing ; no robbing no buying biting why bother ; this slow will stop trying fighting to follow ; my unusual style will confused you a while ; if i was water i flow in the nile ; so many rhymes you will not have time to go for your is ; just because of a because i have to pause ; right after tonight is when i prepare ; to catch another suck duck mc out there ; cops my strategy has to be tragedy catastrophe ; and after this you will call me your majesty ; my melody ; verse five ; marley mail synthesized it i memorize it ; eric b made a cut and advertised it ; my melody is created for mc is in the place ; who try to listen cops i am dissing ; take off your necklace you try to detect my pace ; now you are bugging over off my rhyme like bass ; the melody that i am styling smooth as a violin ; rough enough to break new york from long island ; my wisdom is shift no matter if ; my momentum is slow mc is still stand stuff ; i am genuine like leather do not try to be clever ; so eric b cut it easily ; sip the juice because i got enough to go around ; and the thought takes place uptown ; i grew up on the sidewalk where i learned street talk ; and then taught to hawk new york ; i go to queens for queens to get the crew from brooklyn ; make money in manhattan and never been tooken ; go uptown and the bronx to boogie down ; get strong on the island recoup and lay around ; time to build my juice back up ; props back up suckers get smacked up ; do not doubt the cloud you know what i am about ; knocking nigga off knocking nigga out ; shaking me up waking me up ; making me up breaking me up ; standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge ; let us see if i know the edge ; corner is i trifling because shorty is here ; i get cocked lifting forty is of beer ; here is a sip for the crew that is deceased ; if i get revenge then they rest in peace ; somebody is got to suffer i just might spare one ; and give a brother a fair one ; and i do work with these like hercules ; switch to southpaw split your right jaw ; because i do not like you all i am hype when night fall ; smooth but i move like an army ; bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me ; putting brothers to rest like elliot ness ; because i do not like stress ; streets is not a place for innocent bystanders to stand ; nothing is gonna stop the plan ; i will chill like pacino kill like deniro ; black gambino die like a her ; living on shaky grounds too close to the edge ; let us see if i know the edge ; shells lay around on the battleground ; dead bodies are found throughout the town ; tried to put shame in my game to make a name i am a ; put it on a bullet put it in your brain ; rip the block like a buckshot ; who cares where it goes just keep the casket closed ; no remorse when a life is lost ; i paid my dues paid the cost ; and my pockets are still fat ; wherever i am at i get the welcome at ; even if my crew step with one deep ; i attract attention people like to peep ; so come say i to the bad guy ; do not say goodbye i do not plan to die ; because i get loose and i got troops ; and crazy juice ; in control of many like ayatollah khomeini ; hang out wit smith and wesson do not try to play me ; i am at war a lot like anwar sadat ; but no warning shot my gun is warm a lot ; when i cook beef the smoke will never clear ; areas intervene but this here is sever ; living life too close to the edge ; hoping that i know the edge ; a brand new more no time to dawn ; shower is on power is on ; late for school i catch the train ; girls sip crystal and whisper my name ; i push up like an exercise ; check the intellect and inspect the thighs ; select the best one pull her to the side ; keep her occupied for the rest of the ride ; read my resume she is know i am ready cool ; just meet me after school ; we can man and grown until your mom come home ; sweating me she did not want to let me loose ; come get me that is if you want to sip the juice ; because the streets await me so i take my gun off safety ; because alot of nigga hate me ; coming out of the building they set me up ; sprayed wit automatics they wet me up ; in a puddle of blood i lay close to the edge ; verse one ; standing by the speaker suddenly i had this ; fever was it me or either summer madness ; because i just can not stand around ; so i get closer and the closer i get the better it sound ; my mind starts to activate rhymes collaborate ; because when i heard the beat i just had to make ; something from the top of my head ; so i fell into the groove of the wax and i said ; how could i move the crowd ; first of all is not no mistakes allowed ; here is the instruction put it together ; it simple is not it but quite clever ; some of you been trying to write rhymes for years ; but weak idea irritate my ears ; is this the best that you can make ; because if not and you got more i will wait ; but do not make me wait too long because i am a move on ; the dancefloor when they put something smooth on ; so turn up the bass it is better when it is loud ; because i like to move the crowd ; move the crowd ; verse two ; imagine me wit the heat that is made by solar ; it gets stronger everytime i hold a ; microphone check the tone to get started ; the like for the microphone is departed ; so leave it up to me my dj is mixing ; everyone is moving or pager to listen ; your hands in the air your mouth shut ; because i am on the mic and eric b is on the cut ; for those that know me indeed i like to flow ; especially when the music is going slow ; it gives me a chance to let everybody know ; it is time to bust out the rakim show ; i am the intelligent wise on the mic i will rise ; right in front of your eyes because i am a surprise ; so i am a let my knowledge be born to a perfection ; all raise due to allah and that is a blessing ; wit knowledge of self there is nothing i can not solve ; at thirty degrees i revolve ; this is actual fact it is not an act it is been proven ; indeed and i proceed to make the crowd keep moving ; move the crowd ; let the rhythm hit them ; i am the arsenal ; i got artillery lyrics of ammo ; rounds of rhythm ; then i am a give them piano ; bring a bulletproof vest ; nothing to ricochet ; ready to aim at the brain ; now what the trigger say ; tempo trifling ; felt like a rifle ; message and melodies ; might go right through ; simultaneously like an uzi ; nothing can cruise me ; lyrics let up when lady say do not lose me ; so reload quickly ; and you better hit me ; while i am letting this fifi get wit me ; you stepping with ou ou seven ; better make it snappy ; no time to do your hair baby ; brothers are busting at me ; beats and bullet us pass me ; none on target ; they want the r hit ; but watch the god get ; quicker the tongue is the trigger ; because i am real fast ; let off some rhythm at them ; let them feel the blast ; penetrate at a crazy rate ; this is not no i ; hit them at point blank range ; and watch them radiate ; running out of ammunition ; i am done with me ; you ask me how i did them ; i let the rhythm hit them ; i push a power that is punishable ; better be a prisoner ; the hit man is the ; brother with charisma ; showing you that i have ; powerful paragraphs ; followers will become leaders ; but without a path ; ya mentally paralyzed ; crippled ya third eye ; rhymes are blurred ; then it occurred that you heard i ; reduced the friction with crucifixion ; let loose the mix then ; boost the pistol ; eric hit them with some of that ; cut like a lumberjack ; and me getting hit back ; it will not be none of that ; i am untouchable ; you see me in d ; when i let the rhythm hit another mc ; lyrics made of lead ; enter your head ; then eruptions of a mass production ; will spread when ; music is louder ; full of gunpower ; microphone machinery ; when i see a crowd of ; party people pumping ; their fist like this ; ya hide in the back ; thinking that i might miss ; but the r is accurate ; plus i am packed up with ; educated punch lines that ; i have to hit ; whatever i aim at ; i like them up ; ya body is weak feel with pain ; that time is up ; you been hit with something ; different is not it ; rakim is gonna radiate and nothing is equivalent ; nothing can harm me ; why try to bar me ; you could not come around to rob with a army ; you will get wrecked by the architect ; so respect them ; i disconnect them soon as i inject them ; with radiation ; put them by the basement ; bust his chest open ; bash his face in ; let it split him ; since he brought his main man with him ; he ask me how i did him ; i let the rhythm hit him ; let it hit him ; dance floor is dangerous ; packed in like a briefcase ; rhythm with real rough rhyme ; beats with deep bass ; girls with tight wants ; maybe they might dance ; tonight if the is on the mike ; there is a slight chance ; the crowd is crucial ; mc is grounds are neutral ; now that you are here let me introduce you ; get ready ; i am hard read like graffiti but steady ; science i drop is real heavy ; radiant energy that will be the penals ; touch the third jail on the pain of remedy ; the prescription is one every hour ; now it is a havoc ; if ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatics ; attention follow directions real close ; keep out of reach of children ; beware of overdose ; too many milligram ; but what made a iller jam ; my rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts ; that kill a man ; i dead for the ear to fear ; might split him ; he will never forget him ; he will rest in peace with them ; at least when he left he will know what hit him ; the last breath of the words of death ; was the rhythm ; now throw you hands in the air and yo go ; rakim will do the rest of this slow ; if i speed they know you will blow the hell up ; if i slow up catch up hell no ; wicked as i kicked it ; do not need to remi it ; because i prefixed it ; reversed and switched it ; to perform to perfection ; section for section ; rhymes keep connecting ; ya guessing what is expand ; blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it ; ya hit the ground burning and woke up frostbitten ; because when i explained ya can not complain for pain ; travel through the brain hit a vein ; then remain let it radiate ; vibes will vibrate ; why did you violated ; now i am a have to let the style break ; means now the tone is ingrown ; after this here is thrown gimme another microphone ; before i get that fifi i met ; whisper i wanna reach your intellect ; kiss her because i wanna give her the most respect ; so i shine and let the write reflect ; hold her mold her make her feel older ; lay her on my shoulder ; everything i told her ; makes her feel secure whenever i am with her ; and you know how i did her ; me and the rhythm hit her ; verse one ; me and eric b was cooling at the paladium ; sorry if you are in a rush do not let me hold ya up ; or interveen or interrupt but ; you got the look i wanna get to know ya better ; i had to let her know but yo i did not sweat her ; because if you woulda seen what i was seeing ; almost looked korean but european ; when she spoke her accent was selfexplanatory ; even her body language told the story ; her name was mahogony win is name was ebony ; so we could talk and see new york ; show time does not start until one of the clock ; and once i entered your mind i would not wanna stop ; carressing ya thoughts till we was thinking the same ; calm ya nerves message ya brain ; each mic is a mineral poetry is protein ; verse is a vitamin affects like codeine ; so tell me how you feel and i will reveals ; a will that will heal ya pain because i am real ; she musta oh need because she could not resist ; she spoke slowly when she told me this she said ; chorus ; over me she is going crazy ; she will rub me on my chest and call me mr sexy ; she said she would have my kids and help me make my next g ; tell me i is not finesse mahogony ; verse two ; so i prescribed her something to revive ; and surprise her she is liver and much more wise ; than the light i shine when my brain cell spark ; come to me so we can blow in the dark ; and soon you can represent the moon ; as long as i keep ya in tone ; i will tell ya who ya are and why ya here ; take it in strike because it might take a year ; it is funny how time lies when ya having fun ; we got close and it was almost one ; she dissed me slow but you know how far a kiss can go ; fuck around and miss the show ; so i told her to hold that thought real tight ; we can finish where we left off later on tonite ; back to the scene of the crime on time ; as they introduced the fiend of the rhyme ; she stood with a birdseye view of me ; thinking of later on of what she would do to me ; the back of the room i could see her eyes gloom ; patient but hoping that the show was over soon ; as the place was ripped in half she made her way to the front row ; i packed my mic as they screamed for an encore ; the speakers were blown plus my mic was some ; besides i got places to go ladies to see ; and she could tell me how crazy she was over me ; we drove off she said she liked the way that i performed ; and could not wait to get soft and warm i said ; looks i receive made it hard to mc ; i can take a hit so i knew that she ; showed her some lights then i took her to the condom ; she was piping hot but i kept my calm so ; she asked how come i do not smile ; as we reached the kingdom she said bring some ; champagne she will entertain then sing some ; sentimental songs real gently ; it hit the spot and you know where it went to ; as we embraced i felt her heart pumping ; i knew she was in the good for something ; so i laid on my back and related ; it was not the perignon that made her collaspe ; over me ; planet earth was my place of birth ; born to be the soul controller of the universe ; besides the part of the map i hit first ; any environment i can adapt when it gets worst ; the rough gets going the going gets rough ; when i start flowing the mic might bust ; the next state i shake from the power i generate ; people in cali used to think it was earthquakes ; because times was hard on the boulevard ; so i vote god and never get scarred and hauled ; but it seems like i am locked in hell ; looking over the edge but the r never fell ; a trip to slip because my nikes got grip ; stand on my own two feet and come equipped ; any stage i am seen on or mic i fiend on ; i stand alone and need nothing to lean on ; going for self with a long way to go ; so much to say but i still flow slow ; i come correct and i will not look back ; because it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; even the ghetto ; i learn to relax in my room and escape from new york ; and return through the bomb of the world as a thought ; thinking how hard it was to be born ; me been cream with no physical for ; millions of cell with one destination ; to reach the best part as life is creation ; nine months later a job well done ; make way because here i come ; since i made it this far i can not stop now ; there is a will and a way and i got the knowhow ; to be all i can be and more ; and see all there is to see before ; i am called to go back to the essence ; it is a lot to learn so i study my lessons ; i thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me ; i am glad i listened when my father was rapping to me ; because back in the days they lived in cares ; exiled from the original man they stayed away ; now that is what i call hard times ; i would rather be here to exercise the mind ; then i take a thought around the world twine ; from knowledge to born back to knowledge precise ; across the desert that is hot as the arabian ; but they could not have me in because i am the asia ; reaching for the city of mecca visit medina ; visions of nefertiti then i seen a ; mind keeps traveling i will be back after ; i stop and think about the brothers and sisters in africa ; return the thought through the eye of a needle ; for miles i thought and i just brought the people ; under the dark skins on a dark side ; not only there but right here is an apartheid ; so now is the time for us to react ; take a trip through the mind and when you get back ; understand your third eye seen all of that ; it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; even the ghetto ; no more props i want property in every borough ; nobody is stopping me because i am thorough ; rhymes i make gimme real state for me to own ; wherever i bless a microphone ; doubleohseven is back and relaxing ; on point and reaction and ready for action ; i am so low key that you might not see me ; incognito and taking it easy ghetto ; quiet as kept on a hush hush ; in front of a crowd i get loud there is a brush ; be calm keep a low pro and play the background ; hoping the whack rapper put the mic back down ; so rip it break it in half go ahead and sam it ; because when it is time to build i am a mechanic ; of bonding and mending attaching and blending ; so many solo there is no ending ; people in my neighborhood they know i am good ; from london to hollywood wherever i stood ; footprints remain on stage ever since ; sidewalks and streets i leave fossils and depts ; when i had sex i left my name on necks ; my trademark was left throughout the projects ; i used to get rich when i played cbo ; so i collect my cash then slide ; i have got my back my gun is on my side ; it should not have to be like that ; i guess it is not where you are from it is where you are at ; even the ghetto ; i am from the ghetto ; word up ; casualties of war ; casualties of war as i approach the barricade ; where is the enemy who do i invade ; bullet us of teflon bulletproof vest rip ; tear ya out of ya frame with a bag full of clips ; because i got a family that wait for my return ; to get back home is my main concern ; i am a get back to new york in one piece ; but i am beat in the sand that is hot as the city streets ; sky lights up like fireworks blind me ; bullet us whistling over my head remind me ; president bush said attack ; flashback to nam i might not make it back ; missle hits the area screams wake me up ; from a war of dreams heat up the my ; basic training trained for torture ; take no prisoners and i just caught ya ; addicted to murder send more bodybags ; they can not identify me leave the nametags ; i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor ; casualties of war x ; day divided the night and night divided the day ; it is all hard work and no play ; more than combat it is far beyond that ; because i got a kill or be killed kind of attack ; area is rapped out there will be no stratego ; me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go ; but what are we here for who is on the other side of the wall ; somebody give the president a call ; but i hear warfare scream through the air ; back to the battlegrounds it is war they declare ; a desert storm let us see who reign supreme ; something like monopoly a government scheme ; go to the army be all you can be ; another dead soldier hell no not me ; so i start letting off ammunition in every direction ; allah is my only protection ; but wait a minute saddam hussein rays the same ; and this is asia from where i came ; i am on the wrong side so change the target ; shooting at the general and where is the sergeant ; blame it on john hard hawkins for bringing me to america ; now it is mass hysteria ; i get a rush when i see blood dead bodies on the floor ; casualties of war x ; the war is over for now at least ; just because they lost it do not mean it is peace ; it is a long way home it is a lot to think about ; whole generation left in doubt ; innocent families killed in the mist ; it will be more dead people after this ; so i am glad to be alive and walking ; half of my platoon came home in coffins ; except the general buried in the storm ; in its and pieces no need to look for me ; i played it slick and got away with it ; rugged it up so they would think they did it ; now i am home on deserves and you can bet ; when they call i am going awol ; because it is not no way i am going back to war ; when i do not know who or what i am fighting for ; so i wait for terrorists to attack ; every time a truck backfires i fire back ; i look for shelter when a plane is over me ; remember pearl harbor new york could be over g ; kamikaze strapped with bombs ; no peace in the east they want revenge for saddam ; did i hear gunshots or thunder ; no time to wonder somebody is going under ;
