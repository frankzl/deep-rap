as real as it seems the american dream ; is not nothing but another calculated schemes ; to get us locked up shot up back in chains ; to deny us of the future rob our names ; kept my history of mystery but now i see ; the american dream was not meant for me ; because lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me ; promised me freedom education equality ; never gave me nothing but slavery ; and now look at how dangerous you made me ; calling me a mad man because i am strong and bold ; with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told ; promise me emancipation indispute nation ; all you gave my people was our patience ; fathers of our country never cared for me ; they kept my answer shackled up in slavery ; and uncle sam never did a damn thing for me ; except lie about the facts in my history ; so now i am sitting here mad because i am unemployed ; but the government is glad because they enjoyed ; when my people are down so they can screw us around ; time to change the government now panther power ; panther power ; coming straight that resides within ; go toe to toe with a panther and you just can not win ; suffered fame bats suppressed the rest ; the rich get richer and the poor take less ; the american dream was an american nightmare ; you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair ; the klu klux klan tried to keep us out ; besides drew they know no blacks allowed ; with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom ; but now were impatient ; blacks the other skin dead or sell outs ; freedom equality then i will yell out ; panther power ; my mother never let me forget my history ; hoping i was set free chains never put on me ; wanted to be more than just free ; had to know the true facts about my history ; i could not settle for being a statistic ; could not survive in this capitalistic ; government because it was meant to hold us back ; using ignorant drugs to sneak attack ; in my community think of unity ; but when i charged them tried to claim immunity ; i strike america like a case of hard disease ; panther power is running through my arteries ; try to stop oh boy you will be clawed to death ; because i will be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath ; do you remember that is what i am asking you ; you think you living free do not let me laugh at you ; open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains ; said you was not civilized and stole your name ; because some time has passed seem you all forget ; there is not no liberty to you and me we all is not free yet ; panter power ; panther power ; as real as it seems the american dream ; is not nothing but another calculated schemes ;

hit backstage with two minutes to spare ; just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air ; we hear the introduction the audience is loud ; i stepped out on the stage and then i moved the crowd ; winners all over we tried to leave the scene ; but there is a whole crowd of people at the limousine ; pen and paper in my face i could not be mean ; so i was signing autographs at the age of seventeen ; people wonder why i choose to live the hype ;

but you keep calling you are saying to come over ; what do i do go or stay and play it smart ; its getting rougher because i suffer from a burning heart ; my burning heart ; tupac ; i know this girl and her name is minnie ; living in the projects did not own a penny ; met her at a school dance so i took a chance ; walked her to the parking lot for a little romance ; got to my car put the key in the ignition ; turned on the slow jams i was on a mission ; i was catching wild things like the chicken pox ; she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it ; but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet ; i could not quite believe that why a hoochercoocher ; but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher ; tupac ; minnie the moocher was a legend on the block i am from ; a dream girl to many brothers but true to none ; her reputation was enormous a real go getter ; and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her ; maybe it was her smile her personality or ; the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore ; but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert ; real heartbreaker but never get hurt ; she had this boyfriend his name was diamond ; helping minnie out with the little social climbing ; met with politicians peace to many others ; suddenly and instantly they became her lovers ; she took the power that they possessed ; and minnie did it all without getting undressed ; minnie dissed diamond saying that he could not live with her ; but he wanted payment for the things he did for her ; he grabbed the gun sitting on the nightstand ; minnie held the bullet us put the pistol in her right hand ; she was a legend to everyone who knew her ; that is is my memory of minnie the moocher ; ray tyson ; minnie had a boyfriend a gambler ; addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker ; he took her to harlem and all around chinatown ; he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds ; she was an addict tired of the static and poverty ; sick of the same ghetto misery ; see minnie was a young kid looking for excitement ; smokey was a hoodlum heading for inditement ; then one day their relationship stopped ; when smokey was killed by the miccops ; minnie was hurt lost without a clue ; to her there was no chance of getting somebody new ; so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems ; she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams ; ray tyson ; she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden ; he gave her things that this girl was much needing ; a plush house made of gold and steel ; a diamond car with a platt in the wheel ; now you might think this is a lot of stuff ; but to minnie this was not enough ; he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses ; his meal she ate was a dozen courses ; she had a fortune in nickels and dimes ; and she sat around and counted it a billion times ; she had bank yeah minnie was clocking ; had every sucker in the neighborhood jocking ; she would walk by trying all to wink her eye ; send corrections to the typist ; they finally did it whats that ; they stole the mic i grip ; now that its gone whats wrong ; i am feeling tired and sick ; how did they do it i do not know i wasn't sleeping that long ; when i woke up what happened brother ; my microphone was gone ; first i paniced how ; i put the cops on the case ; but they was stumped damn ; without a clue or a trace ; so as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health ; if i want my microphone back i will do it my self ;

over the years i done alot of growing up ; getting drunk thrown up ; cuffed up ; then i said i had enough ; there must be another route way out ; to money and fame i changed my name ; and played a different game ;

because sister you do not need him ; and i is not trying to gas ya up i just call me how i see me ; you know it makes me unhappy what is that ; when brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy ; and since we all came from a woman ; got our name from a woman and our game from a woman ; i wonder why we take from our women ; why we rape our women do we hate our women ; i think it is time to kill for our women ; time to heal our women be real to our women ; and if we do not we will have a race of babies ; that will hate the ladies that make the babies ; and since a man can not make one ; he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one ; so will the real men get up ; i know you are fed up ladies but keep your head up ; keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier ; oooo child things are gonna get brighter ; aiyyo i remember martin gaye used to sing to me ; he had me feeling like black was the thing to be ; and suddenly the ghetto did not seem so tough ; and though we had it rough we always had enough ; i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules ; ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two ; and i realize momma really paid the price ; she nearly gave her life to raise me right ; and all i had to give her was my pipe dream ; of how i would rock the mic and make it to the bright screen ; i am trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents ; it is hard to be legit and still pay the rent ; and in the end it seems i am heading for the pen ; i try and find my friends but they are blowing in the wind ; last night my buddy lost his whole family ; it is gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity ; it seems the rain will never let up ; i try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up ; you know it is funny when it rains it pours ; they got money for wars but can not feed the poor ; say there is not no hope for the youth and the truth is ; it is not no hope for the future ; and then they wonder why we crazy ; i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby ; we is not meant to survive because it is a setup ; and even though you are fed up ; huh ya got to keep your head up ; and uh ; to all the ladies having babies on they own ; i know it is kinda rough and you are feeling all alone ; daddy is long gone and he left you by ya lonesome ; thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want me ; because i think we can make it in fact i am sure ; and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more ; because is not nothing worse than when your son ; wants to know why his daddy do not love him no my ; you can not complain you was dealt this ; hell of a hand without a man feeling helpless ; because there is too many things for you to deal with ; dying inside but outside you are looking fearless ; while tears is rolling down your cheeks ; ya steady hoping things do not all down this week ; because if it did you could not take it and do not blame me ; i was given this world i did not make it ; and now my son is getting older and older and cold ; from having the world on his shoulders ; while the rich kids is driving benz ; i am still trying to hold on to my surviving friends ; and it is crazy it seems it will never let up but ; yo law ; is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one ; yeah mr fuckacop is back ; and i still do not give a fuck ya know what i am saying ;

intitled in the depts of solitude ; and it goes with a something like this ; eh ehhm ; yeah ; i exist in the depths of solitude ; pondering my true goal ; trying to find piece of mine ; and still preserve my soul ; constantly learning to be accepted ; and from all decieve respect ; never comprimising but sometimes risci ; and that is my only regret ; how can there be peace ; a young heart with an old soul ; how can i be in the depts of solitude ; when there are to inside of me ; this duo within me because the perfect opportunity ; to learn and live twine as fast ; as those who accepts simplicity ; yes ; if you are reading between the lines you can understand exactly what my man ; tupac shakur was talking about mayne ; you see in or outside the music industry ; everyone has heard the expression as lonely on top ; well you know ; pac was on top ; it is only naturally that he exsisted ; in the depts of solitude ; of course he was a young heart with an old soul ; and individual with what was a way ahead of his time ; and sometimes when you are ahead of you're time ; you do wonder what your true goal in life is ; when you get so ovius criticising and put down for teaching ; what you have learned to others ; and doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do ; so with that ; pac like all soldiers fought to be accepted ; specially by those who rejected him the most ; and even if you did not like him ; you had to respect him ; see nobodys perfect ; and off course everyone makes mistakes ; but experience is the best teaching if you ask me ; so its important to learn from each mistake ; and try hard not to make the same one twine ; his only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times ; but it was the wild outrages pac ; mixed with the sensitive love in pac ; that made him almost the perfect person ; also made him learn and live twine as fast ; and i am sure he would rather walk through life ; with these multived dimentional personalities ; than to exept beeing one side than simplistic ; anyday ; so being in the depts of solitude if you ask me ; is were the true heros of our times stay ; tupac shakur in our hearts and our minds forever ; rest in peace live in harmony ; this is luda signing out ; you find an mc like me who is strong ; leaving motherfucker is aborted with no verbal support ; and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though ; with a bear and a snake and a panda i am on those ; who can withstand the my power i gain ; and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain ; imagine and keep on wishing upon a star ; finally realizing who the fuck we are ; when i penetrate it is been withstanding faded ; would it be the greatest mc of all time ; when i created rhyme for the simple fact ; when i attack i crush your pride ; my intention to ride every time all night ;

get roast by my lyrics billy dee forty five colt ; and i am out for nine nickel ; i set the mic in flames my name is ins the rebel ; murder one style smash piles straight to pebbles ; mental terrorist specialist at this ; menacing lyricst leave crews defenseless ; can not design landmines lick off like nines ; to paralyze everything ears ring like doorknobs ; heads start to turn like police who pass ; hear the blast my crew bust through like tear gas ; fuck a mask we laced in place like the marshall ; sparkle like live but harder than tarvue ; wreck this rhyme start relentless roughest ; and fuck up the party for you paying motherfucka ; once i commence for you ladies and gents ; i kick rhymes sharper than barbwire fence ; the live and direct from killah hill project ; staten island new york you can not help but to hawk ; lay it on your dental that is if you want it hostile ; sounds so underground i write my rhymes on fossil ; dudes like this force me to get you open ; shit tired of getting shot at ; tired of getting chased by the police and arrested ; nigga need a spot where we can kick it ; a spot where we belong that is just for us ; nigga is not gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood ; you know what i mean where do nigga go when we die ; is not no heaven for a thug nigga ; that is why we go to thug mansion ; that is the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a g ; at thug mansion ; a place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind ; so much pressure in this life of mine i cry at times ; i once contemplated suicide and woulda tried ; but when i held that nine all i could see was my momma is eyes ; no one knows my struggle they only see the trouble ; not knowin it is hard to carry on when no one loves you ; picture me inside the misery of poverty ; no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived ; praying hard for better days promise to hold on ; me and my dawgs is not have a choice but to roll on ; we found a family spot to kick it ; where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit ; a spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we g is ; we still visualize places that we can roll in peace ; and in my mind is eye i see this place the players go in fast ; i got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug is mansion ; nas ; every corner every city ; there is a place where life is a little busy ; little hennessy laid back and cool ; every hour because it is all good ; leave all the stress from the world outside ; every wrong done will be alright i wanna go ; nothing but peace i wanna go love i wanna go nigga ; and street passion every ghetto needs a thug mansion ; a place where death does not reside just thugs who collide ; not to start beef but spark trees no cops rolling by ; no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets ; no reason for nobody is momma to cry ; see i am a good guy i am trying to stick around for my daughter ; but if i should die i know all of my albums support her ; this whole year is been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me ; only difference from me and ossie davis gray hair maybe ; because i feel like my eyes saw too much suffering ; i am just twentysomeodd years i done lost my mother ; and i cried tears of joy i know she smiles on her boy ; i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur ; because like ann jones she raised a ghetto king in a war ; and just for that alone she should not feel no pain no more ; because one day we will all be together sipping heavnly champagne ; what angels saw with golden wings in thug is mansion ; wo nas ; dear momma do not cry your baby boy is down good ; tell the homies i am in heaven and they is not got hoods ; seen a show with martin gaye last night it had me shook ; dripping peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cooke ; then some lady named billie holiday ; sang sitting there kicking it with malcolm until the day came ;

many dreams is what i had and plenty wishes ; no hesitation in extermination of these snitches ; envious bitches they still continue to pursue me ; a couple of movies now the whole world is trying to screw me ; even the cops tried to sue me so what can i do ; but stay true sipping twenty two is of brew ; and now media is trying to test me ; got the press asking questions trying to stress me ; misery is all i see that is my mindstate ; my history with the police is shake the crime rate ; my main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped ; he screamed thug life and emptied the clip ; got tired of running from the police ; they wanted a new regime ; and my regime includes east coast ; includes west coast ; i was more shocked than anything you know i am saying ; but i was not more shocked of him dying ; i was more shocked of him pac is a strong dude yo ; i know dude you know i am saying real strong ; so when they was like he got shot ; i was just more like again ; you know i am saying he always getting shot or shot at ; he going to pull through this one again ; make a few records about it and it is going to be over ; you know i am saying but when he when he died ; i was just like whoa you know i am saying ; kinda took me by ; i mean even though we was going through our drama ; i would never wish death on nobody you know i am saying ; you find an mc like me who is strong ; leaving motherfucker is aborted with no verbal support ; and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though ; with a bear and a snake and a panda i am on those ; who can withstand the my power i gain ; and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain ; imagine and keep on wishing upon a star ; finally realizing who the fuck we are ; when i penetrate it is been withstanding faded ; would it be the greatest mc of all time ; when i created rhyme for the simple fact ; when i attack i crush your pride ; my intention to ride every time all night ; i am faced with the scars beyond this one bar ; for me to put down my guard i am faced with it i am a ride ; breaking in gas with the sixeight all day ; in and out with my pay ; i am soon to count the bodies ; so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation ; so you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing ; we must be based on nothing better than communication ; known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations ; sorry i left that ass waiting ; no more procrastination give up to fate and get that asss shaking ; i am busting and making motherfuckers panic ; do not take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt ; you swear the bitch was planted ; my lyrics motivate the planet ; it is similar to rhythm nation ; but thugged out forgive me janet ; who is in control i am activating yo souls ; you know the way the games get controlled ; yo two years ago a friend of mine ; told me alize and crystal blows your mind ; bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme i wrote ; taking off my coat clearing my throat ; chorus method man ; i got my mind made up come on ; get in get in too ; let it ride tonight is the night ; i got my mind made up come on ; get in get in too ; let it ride tonight is the night ; well i comes through with two packs ; of the bomb prophalaks for protection ; so my fucking sac will not collapse ; because nowaday is shit is evading the xrays ; sending young motherfuckers to an early grave ; i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc is ; shows my heart is as cold as the tundra ; electrifying like thunder i am just too much ; rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch ; i am an mc with lyrics that is the fucking bombay ; ya got dissed that is before it is ingest like balmay ; my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind ; as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine ; there is no escape nah i is not blasting ; i use my mental to assassinate assassin is for those asking ; opposed to laughing raw maniacal villian ; laughter enhances the chances of the killing ; why is that because smiling faces decieve ; you best believe to mc is i am the deadliest disease ; my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe ; ya whole camp is under seige and i am jason vorhees ; in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes ; my verbal snipe your vocab on site ; i am out the cut uncut and raw with no clause for all ; so all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall ; ya already have an idea about the superior sphere ; the greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator ; i rock from here to there to philly and back ; to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps ; as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact ; beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat ; fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers ; like hitler sticking up ; the mr methical from staten isle ; will be back after this message do not touch the dial ; rarely do you see an mc out for justice ; got my gun powder and my musket blaow ; melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen ; half of my clan is three deep felons ; nigga best protect they joints for ninenickel ; man i stay on point like icicles ; now who wanna test tical then touch tical ; all up in your motherfucking mouth ; head banger boogie ; catch me on tour with al doogie ; method man roll too tight you can pull me ; better take one and pass or that is that ass ; your vital statistics are low and falling fast ; johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash ; play a game of russian roulette and have a blast ; aiyyo lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics ; nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards ; let us face it there is no replacement ; taste this mad underground basement shit i am laced with ; avalanche on ya whole camp when i am splifted ; funk doctor who spock bitch do not get it twisted ; i got connects like federal express ; to get the fresh package of bless the dogs can not fetch ; got the clear spot from the rear block ; to bust until every nigga here drop men i fear not ; hold ya nose and blow out until ya ears pop ; since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get is lot ; with this underground cannabis ; i am dangerous like john the bomb analyst ; then proceeds like keys ; my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd up is ; lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake ; so i erase the whole front row at the wake ; i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it ; i am the one pushing the hearse in the first place ; confidence for you shaky ass folks ; pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked ; choke off this anecdote got you ope ; get roast by my lyrics billy dee forty five coly ; and i am out for nine nickel ; you find an mc like me who is strong ; leaving motherfucker is aborted with no verbal support ; and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though ;
